The antibody portion is trastuzumab, which is humanized anti-HER2 IgG1, and produced in the mammalian Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. The drug portion is DM1, which is a maytansine derivative that inhibits microtubules. These two portions are covalently connected by 4-[N-maleimidomethyl] cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (MCC), which is a stable thioether linker. Together MCC and DM1 are called emtansine and are produced by chemical synthesis.
Trastuzumab emtansine binds to the HER2 receptor’s sub-domain IV and goes into the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Lysosomes degrade trastuzumab emtansine and release DM1. DM1 binds to tubulin in microtubules and inhibits microtubule function producing cell arrest and apoptosis. As well, similar to trastuzumab, in vitro studies have shown that both HER2 receptor signalling inhibition and antibody-dependent cytotoxicity are mediated by trastuzumab emtansine.

Under low glucose concentrations, SUR1 remains open, allowing for potassium ion efflux to create a -70mV membrane potential.7
Normally SUR1 closes in response to high glucose concentrations, the membrane potential of the cells becomes less negative, the cell depolarizes, voltage gated calcium channels open, calcium ions enter the cell, and the increased intracellular calcium concentration stimulates the release of insulin containing granules.7
Glyburide bypasses this process by forcing SUR1 closed and stimulating increased insulin secretion.7

In single doses, the effect of maprotiline on the EEG revealed a rise in the alpha-wave density, a reduction of the alpha-wave frequency and an increase in the alpha-wave amplitude. However, as with other tricyclic antidepressants, maprotiline lowers the convulsive threshold. Maprotiline acts as an antagonist at central presynaptic a2-adrenergic inhibitory autoreceptors and hetero-receptors, an action that is postulated to result in an increase in central noradrenergic and serotonergic activity. Maprotiline is also a moderate peripheral a1 adrenergic antagonist, which may explain the occasional orthostatic hypotension reported in association with its use. Maprotiline also inhibits the amine transporter, delaying the reuptake of noradrenaline and norepinephrine. Lastly, maprotiline is a strong inhibitor of the histamine H1 receptor, which explains its sedative actions.

Current knowledge suggests that levetiracetam’s binding to synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) is a key driver of its action. SV2A is a membrane-bound protein that is found on synaptic vesicles and is ubiquitous throughout the CNS4 - it appears to play a role in vesicle exocytosis11,15 and in the modulation of synaptic transmission by increasing the available amount of secretory vesicles available for neurotransmission.7 Stimulation of pre-synaptic SV2A by levetiracetam may inhibit neurotransmitter release,6 but this action does not appear to affect normal neurotransmission. This has led to the suggestion that levetiracetam exclusively modulates the function of SV2A only under pathophysiological conditions.4 Levetiracetam and related analogues showed a correlation between affinity for SV2A and anti-epileptic potency, further suggesting that action at this site contributes to the anti-epileptic activity of the drug.11,15
Levetiracetam has also been shown to indirectly affect GABAergic neurotransmission (despite having no direct effect on GABAergic or glutamatergic receptors) and modulate ionic currents.7 Similarly, levetiracetam has been shown in vitro to inhibit N-type calcium channels.8 How, or even if, these actions are implicated in its anti-epileptic action have yet to be elucidated.

Hyperpigmented skin appears to fade more rapidly than does normal skin, and exposure to sunlight reduces the depigmenting effect of the drug. Following skin depigmentation after topical application of monobenzone, the histological studies indicate similar results as that seen in vitiligo, where the epidermis is intact but with the absence of identifiable melanocytes.

One theory is that acetaminophen increases the pain threshold by inhibiting two isoforms of cyclooxygenase, COX-1 and COX-2, which are involved in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis. Prostaglandins are responsible for eliciting pain sensations.13 Acetaminophen does not inhibit cyclooxygenase in peripheral tissues and, therefore, has no peripheral anti-inflammatory effects. Though acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is an irreversible inhibitor of COX and directly blocks the active site of this enzyme, studies have shown that acetaminophen (paracetamol) blocks COX indirectly.24 Studies also suggest that acetaminophen selectively blocks a variant type of the COX enzyme that is unique from the known variants COX-1 and COX-2.6 This enzyme has been referred to as COX-3. The antipyretic actions of acetaminophen are likely attributed to direct action on heat-regulating centers in the brain, resulting in peripheral vasodilation, sweating, and loss of body heat.24 The exact mechanism of action of this drug is not fully understood at this time, but future research may contribute to deeper knowledge.24

Studies have suggested a direct inhibition of cell membrane/cell wall constituent biosynthesis, including peptidoglycan, uridine diphosphate-N-acid, acetyl-L-alanine, and lipoteichoic acid (LTA). However, no convincing evidence has been presented for any of these models, and an effect on LTA biosynthesis has been ruled out by other studies in S. aureus and E. faecalis.8,10,11
It is well understood that free daptomycin (apo-daptomycin) is a trianion at physiological pH, which binds Ca2+ in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio to become a monoanion, which is thought to rely primarily on the Asp(7), Asp(9), and L-3MeGlu12 residues that form a DXDG motif.6,7,8 Calcium-binding facilitates daptomycin's insertion into bacterial membranes preferentially due to their high content of the acidic phospholipids phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL), wherein it is proposed that daptomycin can bind two calcium equivalents and form oligomers.7 PG is recognized as the main membrane requirement for daptomycin activity; daptomycin preferentially localizes in PG-rich membrane domains, and mutations affecting PG prevalence are linked to daptomycin resistance.7 Calcium-dependent membrane binding is the generally accepted mechanism of action for daptomycin, but the precise downstream effects are unclear, and numerous models have been proposed.
One mechanism proposes that the daptomycin membrane binding alters membrane fluidity, causing dissociation of cell wall biosynthetic enzymes such as the lipid II synthase MurG and the phospholipid synthase PlsX.8 This is consistent with the observed effects of daptomycin on cell shape in various bacteria at concentrations at or above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).11 Aberrant cell morphology is also consistent with the observed localization of daptomycin at the division septa and a hypothesized role in inhibiting cell division.7 A recent study suggested the formation of tripartite complexes containing calcium-bound daptomycin, PG, and various undecaprenyl-coupled cell envelope precursors, which subsequently include lipid II. This complex is proposed to inhibit cell division, lead to the dispersion of cell wall biosynthetic machinery, and eventually cause lysis of the membrane bilayer at the septum causing cell death.8,12
Another popular model is based on early observations that daptomycin, in a calcium-dependent manner, caused potassium ion leakage and loss of membrane potential in treated bacterial cells.10,13,14 Although this lead some to suggest that daptomycin could bind PG to form oligomeric pores in the bacterial membrane,8 no cell lysis was observed in S. aureus or E. faecalis,7 and the daptomycin-induced ion conduction is inconsistent with pore formation.15 Rather, it has been proposed that daptomycin forms calcium-dependent dimeric complexes in fixed ratios of Dap2Ca3PG2, which can act as transient ionophores.15 The observed loss of membrane potential is suggested to result in a non-specific loss of gradient-dependent nutrient transport, ATP production, and biosynthesis, leading to cell death.7,14
Notably, these models are not strictly mutually exclusive and are supported to varying extents by observed resistance mutations. The strict requirement for PG for daptomycin bactericidal action is supported by mutations in mprF, cls2, pgsA, and the dlt operon in S. aureus, cls in various enterococci, and pgsA, PG synthase, and the dlt operon in E. faecium, all of which alter the bacterial membrane composition and specifically the PG content of bacterial membranes. Other noted mutations in various regulatory systems that control membrane homeostasis also support the cell membrane as the site of daptomycin action. Curiously, in E. faecalis, the most commonly observed form of daptomycin resistance is characterized by abnormal division septa, which supports the cell division-based mechanism of daptomycin action.7,8

About 4-5% of NSCLCs have a chromosomal rearrangement that generates a fusion gene between EML4 (echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4) and ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase), which results in constitutive kinase activity that contributes to carcinogenesis and seems to drive the malignant phenotype. Ceritinib exerts its therapeutic effect by inhibiting autophosphorylation of ALK, ALK-mediated phosphorylation of the downstream signaling protein STAT3, and proliferation of ALK-dependent cancer cells. Ceritinib has been shown to inhibit in vitro proliferation of cell lines expressing EML4-ALK and NPM-ALK fusion proteins and demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of EML4-ALK-positive NSCLC xenograft growth in mice and rats.

Normally, calcium ions serve as intracellular messengers or activators in exictable cells including vascular smooth muscles. The influx of calcium ultimately causes the excitation and depolarization of the tissues. Lacidipine inhibits the contractile function in the vascular smooth muscle and reduce blood pressure. Due to its high membrane partition coefficient, some studies suggest that lacidipine may reach the receptor via a two-step process; it first binds and accumulates in the membrane lipid bilayer and then diffuses within the membrane to the calcium channel receptor 5. It is proposed that lacidipine preferentially blocks the inactivated state of the calcium channel 5.
Through its antioxidant properties shared amongst other dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, lacidipine demonstrates an additional clinical benefit. Its antiatherosclerotic effects are mediated by suppressing the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and subsequent inflammatory actions by chemokines, cytokines and adhesion molecules, thus reducing atherosclerotic lesion formation 4. Lacidipine may also suppress cell proliferation and migration in smooth muscle cells and suppress the expression of matrix metalloproteinases, which affects the stability of atheromatous plaques 4.

It displays high affinity for the channels expressed in the smooth muscle cells in the vascular wall. Its main mechanism of action arises from the reduction of peripheral vascular resistance secondary to its vasodilatory actions. 
Calcium ion influx via L-subtype ‘voltage-operated’ channels in the excitable membranes of the smooth muscle cells promotes the formation of calcium-dependent formation of cross-bridges between myosin and actin which are the two major contractile proteins that drive contraction. By blocking the L-type 'voltage-dependent' calcium channels, barnidipine selectively blocks the calcium ion influx in the smooth muscle cells and inhibits the activation of contractile proteins 3. It is suggested that barnidipine displays a high affinity to the inactivated state of the channel 5. Like other dihydropyridine calcium antagonists, barnidipine is predicted to interact with the alpha 1-C subunit of the L-type calcium channels. Alpha 1-C subunit of the channel is predicted to reside within the bilayer or channel pore at a location closer to the extracellular rather than the intracellular face of the membrane 6,7. Its lipophilicity is likely a reason why barnidipine displays a slow onset and long duration of action. Being a highly lipophilic molecule with an octanol/water partition coefficient of 2000, barnidipine is expected to accumulate in the cell membrane and consequently, gains access to its target receptor in a slow manner 3.

Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid hormone involved in the regulation of blood pressure, sodium reabsorption, and potassium excretion.2 In 1943, agonism of the MR along with increased salt was shown to be associated with malignant hypertension, which could progress to inflammation and fibrosis of organs.2
Binding of aldosterone, an MR agonist, to the MR causes a conformational change, which dissociates the receptor from inactivating chaperone proteins.5 The active MR translocates to the nucleus along with a complex of other coactivators to induce transcription of a number of genes.5
Finerenone's binding to the MR prevents binding of MR coactivators, which in turn prevents pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic gene transcription.2,3
Clinical trial data shows that blocking the mineralocorticoid receptor reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic severe congestive heart failure with an ejection fraction =35%.4 Patients taking finerenone developed new onset atrial fibrillation or flutter (AFF) with a hazard ratio of 0.71.3 Finerenone lowered the risk of first onset of kidney failure, a sustained eGFR decrease of =40%, or death from a renal cause to a hazard ratio of 0.82.3 Cardiovascular outcomes including cardiovascular death, nonfatal heart attacks, nonfatal strokes, and hospitalization for heart failure in patients taking finerenone had a hazard ratio of 0.86 in patients with a history of AFF and 0.85 in patients without a history of AFF.3

Schizophrenia is thought to result from an excess of dopaminergic D2 and serotonergic 5-HT2A activity, resulting in overactivity of central mesolimbic pathways and mesocortical pathways, respectively.3,4,5
D2 dopaminergic receptors are transiently inhibited by risperidone, reducing dopaminergic neurotransmission, therefore decreasing positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as delusions and hallucinations. Risperidone binds transiently and with loose affinity to the dopaminergic D2 receptor, with an ideal receptor occupancy of 60-70% for optimal effect.7,10 Rapid dissociation of risperidone from the D2 receptors contributes to decreased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), which occur with permanent and high occupancy blockade of D2 dopaminergic receptors.6,7 Low-affinity binding and rapid dissociation from the D2 receptor distinguish risperidone from the traditional antipsychotic drugs. A higher occupancy rate of D2 receptors is said to increase the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms and is therefore to be avoided.6,7,8
Increased serotonergic mesocortical activity in schizophrenia results in negative symptoms, such as depression and decreased motivation. The high-affinity binding of risperidone to 5-HT2A receptors leads to a decrease in serotonergic activity. In addition, 5-HT2A receptor blockade results in decreased risk of extrapyramidal symptoms, likely by increasing dopamine release from the frontal cortex, and not the nigrostriatal tract. Dopamine level is therefore not completely inhibited.5,7 Through the above mechanisms, both serotonergic and D2 blockade by risperidone are thought to synergistically work to decrease the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms. 
Risperidone has also been said to be an antagonist of alpha-1 (a1), alpha-2 (a2), and histamine (H1) receptors.13 Blockade of these receptors is thought to improve symptoms of schizophrenia, however the exact mechanism of action on these receptors is not fully understood at this time.15

Acne is a multifactorial condition, and evidence exists to support multiple mechanisms of action for adapalene. Adapalene binds to retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-beta and RAR-gamma; this complex subsequently binds to one of three retinoid X receptors (RXRs), which as a complex is capable of binding DNA to modulate transcriptional activity.1 Although the full extent of transcriptional modulation is not described, retinoid activation is generally known to affect cellular proliferation and differentiation7, and adapalene has been shown to inhibit HeLa cell proliferation and human keratinocyte differentiation.3 These effects primarily account for adapalene's comedolytic and anticomedogenic properties.
In addition, adapalene modulates the immune response by down-regulating toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2) expression and inhibiting the transcription factor activator protein 1 (AP-1). TLR-2 recognizes Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes), the bacterium primarily associated with acne. TLR-2 activation causes nuclear translocation of AP-1 and downstream pro-inflammatory gene regulation. Therefore, adapalene has a general anti-inflammatory effect, which reduces inflammation-mediated acne symptoms.2
When used with benzoyl peroxide, which possesses free radical-mediated bactericidal effects, the combination acts synergistically to reduced comedones and inflammatory lesions.2

Specifically, N-type channel activation in lightly myelinated Ad- and C-fibres is known to mediate the release of neurotransmitters substance P (SP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and glutamate, which influence downstream neural activation and pain perception.8,14,15,16,17 In addition, SP and CGRP induce inflammation, potentially exacerbating pre-existing inflammatory chronic pain.14
Ziconotide belongs to the <U+03C9>-conotoxin class of neurotoxic peptides derived from the cone snail Conus magus which are capable of inhibiting N-type VGCCs.4,5,7,9,18 Although the exact mechanism is yet to be elucidated, it is thought that <U+03C9>-conotoxins function through direct occlusion of the ion pore to prevent calcium translocation across the membrane.9 Additional studies involving expression of chimeric subunits and molecular modelling suggest that insertion of the ziconotide Met12 residue into a hydrophobic pocket formed by Ile300, Phe302, and Leu305 of Cav2.2 increases binding and may be associated with toxic adverse effects.11

Fabry disease-causing mutations occur in the galactosidase alpha (GLA) gene and result in a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A) that is required for glycosphingolipid substrate (GL-3 and lyso-Gb3) metabolism Label,6. Reduced alpha-Gal A activity is, therefore, associated with the progressive accumulation of glycosphingolipid substrate in vulnerable organs and tissues, which ultimately leads to the morbidity and mortality associated with Fabry disease Label,6.
Certain GLA mutations can result in the production of abnormally folded and unstable mutant forms of alpha-Gal A Label,6. Migalastat is subsequently a pharmacological chaperone that is designed to selectively and reversibly bind with high affinity to the active sites of certain mutant forms of alpha-Gal A, the genotypes of which are referred to as amenable mutations Label,6. Such migalastat binding stabilizes these mutant forms of alpha-Gal A in the endoplasmic reticulum and facilitates their proper trafficking to lysosomes Label,6. Once in the lysosomes and surrounded by an environment defined by lower pH and higher concentrations of relevant glycosphingolipid substrates, migalastat dissociates from alpha-Gal A, thereby restoring the alpha-Gal A activity, leading to the catabolism of glycosphingolipids like globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) and globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) since the alpha-Gal A variants still retain enzymatic activity Label,6.
The GLA mutations that are amenable and not amenable to treatment with migalastat are regularly maintained and updated on online sites that are readily accessible by healthcare providers Label,6.

Secretin mediates an inhibitory effect on acid secretion by parietal cells of the stomach, and causes alkalinazation of the duodenal content by stimulating the release of pancreatic juice, which has high amounts of water and bicarbonate ions 5. Bicarbonate ions are released into the duodenum from the centroacinar cells, and epithelia lining the pancreatic and biliary ducts 3. Human secretin is a ligand at G-protein coupled secretin receptors which are expressed in the basolateral domain of several tissue cell types 3, including pancreas, stomach, liver, colon and other tissues Label. Upon interaction, levels of cAMP increase and initiates the cAMP-mediated signalling cascade that results in phosphorylation of protein kinase A (PKA) and activation of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) 3. Activation of CFTR activates Cl-/HCO3- anion exchanger 2 and leads to secretion of bicarbonate-rich-pancreatic fluid 3. Via the same cAMP signalling pathway, secretin promotes the secretion of water and electrolytes in cholangiocytes 3. Secretin may work through vagal-vagal neural pathways since stimulation of the efferent vagus nerve stimulates bicarbonate secretion and atropine blocks secretin-stimulated pancreatic secretion Label.

The presence of different mutations in vWF causes a common bleeding disorder named von Willebrand disease.6 The bleeding episodes were usually treated with plasma-derived vWF/factor VIII concentrates which required high doses and long treatment duration. The use of vonicog alfa allows a separate administration of vWF without the presence of the Factor VIII. This separate dosing allows the personalization of the dosage according to the patient's needs.2 On the same note, the plasma-derived vWF concentrates variably lack ULM due to an in vivo exposure to plasma ADAMTS13 and granulocyte elastases. Vonicog alfa can be delivered as an unaltered vWF and it functions as a replacement of vWF.

V1 receptors are abundantly expressed in the brain whereby vasopressin binding can increase blood pressure through autonomic pathways.6 Peripherally, V1 is localized in the blood vessels (vascular smooth muscle), platelets, adrenal glands, kidneys, and liver.6,8 Vasopressin binding to V1 causes hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate into inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) by phospholipase C, which in turn release intracellular calcium and activate protein kinase C (PKC) to open voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) while closing potassium channels. Overall, intracellular calcium levels rise, which bind calmodulin and cause muscular contraction, resulting in vasoconstriction.7 This is balanced by the apparent ability of vasopressin to induce vasodilation through binding oxytocin receptors and activating endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase; NO acts antagonistically to reduce muscle contraction.7 It is also thought that vasopressin, acting through both V1 and oxytocin receptors, causes the cardiac release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which has a negative inotropic effect; indeed, vasopressin tends to decrease heart rate and cardiac output, although the opposite effect has been noted with low doses.7,10
V2 receptors are abundantly expressed in the distal convoluted tubules and the collecting ducts of the kidneys.8,9 Vasopressin binding to V2 causes activation of a Gs protein that subsequently activates protein kinase A (PKA) through adenylyl cyclase-mediated increase in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which leads to phosphorylation of the water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) and its trafficking to the cell surface.8,9 Increased AQP2 levels lead to increased water reabsorption and explains vasopressin's antidiuretic effects.8
V3 (formerly V1B) receptors are primarily located in the anterior pituitary and brain.6,8 Vasopressin released during acute stress causes adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release from the pituitary through V3 and by potentiating the effects of corticotrophin-releasing factor. Within the brain itself, V3 activation modulates various effects, including recognition, memory, aggression, anxiety, and depression.6
Thus, vasopressin can affect a wide variety of physiological processes, often in apparently contradictory ways depending on the patient's dose and physiological state. Vasodilatory shock causes an immediate release of vasopressin from 20 to 200 times its normal serum concentration, which falls again to normal levels in prolonged shock; in this context, normal serum levels are insufficient to control the pathologic vasodilation.7,8 In these cases, vasopressin acts to depolarize hyperpolarized vascular smooth muscle cells, restore sensitivity to catecholamines, and inhibit excessive nitric oxide production, primarily through acting through V1 receptors. Therefore, vasopressin helps decrease the dose requirement for norepinephrine and is routinely administered together with norepinephrine to restore normal blood pressure in shock states.8,10

Capreomycin also binds to components in the bacterial cell which result in the production of abnormal proteins. These proteins are necessary for the bacteria's survival. Therefore the production of these abnormal proteins is ultimately fatal to the bacteria.

MET plays a critical role in the proliferation, survival, invasion, and mobilization of tumor cells, and aberrant MET activation is thought to contribute to the development of more aggressive cancers with poorer prognoses.2
Tepotinib is a kinase inhibitor directed against MET, including variants with exon 14 skipping - it inhibits MET phosphorylation and subsequent downstream signaling pathways in order to inhibit tumor cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and migration of MET-dependent tumor cells.7 Tepotinib has also been observed to down-regulate the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) promoting genes (e.g. MMP7, COX-2, WNT1, MUC5B, and c-MYC) and upregulate the expression of EMT-suppressing genes (e.g. MUC5AC, MUC6, GSK3ß, and E-cadherin) in c-MET-amplified gastric cancer cells,2 suggesting that the tumor-suppressing activity of tepotinib is driven, at least in part, by the negative regulation of c-MET-induced EMT. It has also been shown to inhibit melatonin 1B and nischarin at clinically relevant concentrations, though the relevance of this activity in regards to tepotinib's mechanism of action is unclear.7

The affinity (Kd) of EPO for its receptor on human cells is ~100 to 200 pM 4. Upon binding to EPO-R on the surface of erythroid progenitor cells, a conformational change is induced which brings EPO-R-associated Janus family tyrosine protein kinase 2 (JAK2) molecules into close proximity. JAK2 molecules are subsequently activated via phosphorylation, then phosphorylate tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of the EPO-R that serve as docking sites for Src homology 2-domain-containing intracellular signaling proteins 3. The signalling proteins include STAT5 that once phosphorylated by JAK2, dissociates from the EPO-R, dimerizes, and translocates to the nucleus where they serve as transcription factors to activate target genes involved in cell division or differentiation, including the apoptosis inhibitor Bcl-x 3. The inhibition of apoptosis by the EPO-activated JAK2/STAT5/Bcl-x pathway is critical in erythroid differentiation. Via JAK2-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation, erythropoietin and epoetin alfa also activates other intracellular proteins involved in erythroid cell proliferation and survival, such as Shc , phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and phospholipase C-<U+03B3>1 3.

In contrast, low doses are found to selectively activate NE and DE neurotransmission within the prefrontal cortex which is an area of the brain thought to play a prominent role in ADHD pathophysiology, thereby improving clinical efficacy and preventing side effects.8 The lower doses used to treat ADHD are not associated with the locomotor-activating effects associated with higher doses and instead reduce movement, impulsivity, and increase cognitive function including sustained attention and working memory.6,7 Methylphenidate's beneficial effects in sustaining attention have also been shown to be mediated by alpha-1 adrenergic receptor activity.9
Clinical findings have shown that children with ADHD have an abnormality in the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1), the D4 receptor gene (DRD-4), and/or the D2 receptor gene that may be at least partly overcome by the dopaminergic effects of methylphenidate, suggesting a possible mode of action.15

By acting as an antagonist at histamine type 1 (H1) receptors, dosulepin mediates a sedative effect. 
Main metabolites northiaden, dothiepin sulphoxide and northiaden sulphoxide may also bind to 5HT, a2 and H1 receptors, although with less affinity compared to the parent drug 3.

Baclofen is an agonist at the beta subunit of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors expressed on pre- and post-synaptic neurons.3 Upon binding to GABAB receptors, baclofen causes an influx of potassium into the neuron, leading to hyperpolarization of the neuronal membrane and decreased calcium influx at presynaptic nerve terminals. This results in a decreased rate of action potential threshold being reached by presynaptic neurons and reduced action potential of postsynaptic motor neurons that innervate the muscle spindles. Baclofen thereby inhibits the transmission of both mono- and polysynaptic reflexes at the spinal cord, relaxing spasticity.8 Baclofen may act on some voltage-gated calcium channels; however, the clinical significance of this is unclear.6

Paramagnetic agents have unpaired electrons that generate a magnetic field about 700 times larger than the proton's field, thus disturbing the proton's local magnetic field. When the local magnetic field around a proton is disturbed, its relaxation process is altered. MR images are based on proton density and proton relaxation dynamics. MR instruments can record 2 different relaxation processes, the T1 (spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation time) and the T2 (spin-spin or transverse relaxation time). In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), visualization of normal and pathological brain tissue depends in part on variations in the radiofrequency signal intensity that occur with changes in proton density, alteration of the T1, and variation in the T2. When placed in a magnetic field, Gadobenate Dimeglumine shortens both the T1 and the T2 relaxation times in tissues where it accumulates. At clinical doses, Gadobenate Dimeglumine primarily affects the T1 relaxation time, thus producing an increase in signal intensity. Gadobenate Dimeglumine does not cross the intact blood-brain barrier; therefore, it does not accumulate in normal brain tissue or in central nervous system (CNS) lesions that have not caused an abnormal blood-brain barrier (e.g., cysts, mature post-operative scars)."

Signaling through the histamine H1 receptor is thought to primarily promote the activation of inflammatory reactions, such as allergy, asthma, and autoimmune diseases.4 H1 receptor signaling activates the intracellular transcription factors, such as IP3, PLC, PKC, DAG, and intracellular calcium ions, which all work to activate further downstream cascades. Activated downstream cascades lead to the production of cytokines, the release of mast cell inflammatory mediators, synthesis of prostacyclins, activation of platelet factor, as well as the synthesis of nitric oxide, arachidonic acid, and thromboxane, which all contribute to inflammatory reactions.4
Olopatadine is an anti-allergic molecule that works via several mechanisms. As a mast cell stabilizer, it stabilizes rodent basophils and human conjunctival mast cells and inhibits the immunologically-stimulated release of histamine.3 Olopatadine acts as an antagonist at the histamine H1 receptors with high selectivity, which is explained by a unique receptor binding pocket that consists of the aspartate residue in the third transmembrane helix and other sites in the H1 receptor.1 Upon binding, olopatadine blocks the H1 receptor signaling pathway, inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators, such as tryptase, prostaglandin D2, TNF-alpha, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines.10 It also decreases chemotaxis and inhibits eosinophil activation.7In vitro, olopatadine was shown to inhibit epithelial cell intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which promotes the recruitment of migrating pro-inflammatory mediators.3

In addition, the production of free radicals may contribute to its anti-psoriatic effect 13. In vitro studies demonstrate that anthralin prolongs the prophase component of mitosis for keratinocytes and leukocytes 7. Prophase is the first step of mitosis, the process separating the duplicated genetic material carried in the nucleus of a parent cell into two identical daughter cells 14. In vivo studies demonstrate that anthralin blocks DNA synthesis and can increase the release of reactive oxygen species 7.
Anthralin is believed to normalize the rate of epidermal cell proliferation and keratinization by reducing the mitotic activity of the epidermal hyperplasia in psoriasis 13.
Anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory effects of anthralin have been demonstrated on both psoriatic and healthy skin. The anti-proliferative effects of anthralin are thought to be due to a combination of inhibition of DNA synthesis and its strong reducing properties. The effectiveness of anthralin as an anti-psoriatic agent is partly owed to its ability to promote lipid peroxidation and reduce the concentration of endothelial adhesion molecules, which are found to be elevated in psoriatic patients 8, 13.
Recent studies suggest that its ability to prevent T-lymphocyte activation and normalize keratinocyte differentiation may occur by a direct effect on mitochondria 4.

This protein acts as a channel and allows for the passage of chloride and sodium. This process affects the movement of water in and out of the tissues and impacts the production of mucus that lubricates and protects certain organs and body tissues, including the lungs. In the F508del mutation of the CFTR gene, one amino acid is deleted at the position 508, therefore, the CFTR channel function is compromised, resulting in thickened mucus secretions.10 CFTR correctors such as tezacaftor aim to repair F508del cellular misprocessing.9 This is done by modulating the position of the CFTR protein on the cell surface to the correct position, allowing for adequate ion channel formation and increased in water and salt movement through the cell membrane.10 The concomitant use of ivacaftor is intended to maintain an open channel, increasing the transport of chloride, reducing thick mucus production.13

Additionally, this agent may induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against CCR4-positive T cells. CCR4, a G-coupled-protein receptor for C-C chemokines such MIP-1, RANTES, TARC and MCP-1, is expressed on the surfaces of some types of T cells, endothelial cells, and certain types of neurons. CCR4, also known as CD194, may be overexpressed on adult T-cell lymphoma (ATL) and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) cells 10. In addition to directly targeting malignant T cells expressing CCR4, mogamulizumab depletes Treg cells, an important therapeutic target in many human cancers because of their role in suppressing host antitumor immunity 6.

The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism. In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR. Substitution of the proline residue at B28 with aspartic acid reduces the tendency to form hexamers and results in a faster rate of absorption and onset of action and shorter duration of action.

Iodine based contrast media are water soluble and harmless to the body. These contrast agents are sold as clear colorless water solutions, the concentration is usually expressed as mg I/ml. Modern iodinated contrast agents can be used almost anywhere in the body.

Elevated extracellular levels of PPi block hydroxyapatite crystal growth which inhibits bone mineralization and causes an accumulation of unmineralized bone matrix which manifests as rickets and bone deformation in infants and children and as osteomalacia (softening of bones) once growth plates close, along with muscle weakness. Replacement of the TNSALP enzyme upon Asfotase alfa treatment reduces the enzyme substrate levels.

Osteoclasts mediate resorption of bone.7 When osteoclasts bind to bone they form podosomes, ring structures of F-actin.7 Etidronic acid also inhibits V-ATPases in the osteoclast, though the exact subunits are unknown, preventing F-actin from forming podosomes.12,13,11 Disruption of the podosomes causes osteoclasts to detach from bones, preventing bone resorption.7
Nitrogen containing bisphosphonates such as zoledronate are known to induce apoptosis of hematopoietic tumor cells by inhibiting the components of the mevalonate pathway farnesyl diphosphate synthase, farnesyl diphosphate, and geranylgeranyl diphosphate.10,9 These components are essential for post-translational prenylation of GTP-binding proteins like Rap1.10,9 The lack of prenylation of these proteins interferes with their function, and in the case of Rap1, leads to apoptosis.10,9 zoledronate also activated caspases which further contribute to apoptosis.10,9

It has been modified to replicate within tumor cells and to produce the immune response stimulatory protein, human GM-CSF (granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor) 3. The medication causes the death of tumor cells and the release of tumor-derived antigens 3. It is believed that together with GM-CSF, talimogene laherparepvec can promote a systemic anti-tumor immune response and an effector T-cell response 3. Mice subjects involved in talimogene laherparepvec treatment studies that had complete regression of their primary tumors following therapy were resistant to subsequent tumor rechallenge 3.
The genetic modifications to talimogene laherparepvec from HSV-1 include deletion of the ICP34.5 and ICP47 genes 3. Whereas anti-viral immune responses defend normal cells following infection by talimogene laherparepvec, tumors have been shown to be susceptible to injury and cell death from ICP34.5-deficient HSV-1 derived viruses, including talimogene laherparepvec 3. Moreover, deletion of ICP47 prevents the down-regulation of antigen presentation molecules in the targeted tumor cells and increases the expression of the HSV US11 gene, thereby enhancing the talimogene laherparepvec viral replication in tumor cells and increases chances of tumor cell injury and death 3.
Although the talimogene laherparepvec virus is specifically modified to infect and multiply inside melanoma cells and uses melanoma cells' own machinery to multiply, the medication is not designed to multiply inside healthy cells, which it is also capable of entering 4.

STATs modulate intracellular activity, including gene transcription of inflammatory mediators that promote an autoimmune response,2,3,7,9 such as IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-15, IL-23, IFN-<U+03B3>, GM-CSF, and interferons.2,3 The JAK-STAT pathway has been implicated in the pathophysiology of rheumatoid arthritis, as it is associated with an overproduction of inflammatory mediators.3
There are four JAK proteins: JAK 1, JAK 2, JAK 3 and TYK2. JAKs form homodimers or heterodimers and pair differently in different cell receptors to transmit cytokine signaling.7,9 Baricitinib is a selective and reversible inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 with less affinity for JAK3 and TYK2; however, the relevance of inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to therapeutic effectiveness is not currently known.9 Baricitinib inhibits the activity of JAK proteins and modulates the signaling pathway of various interleukins, interferons, and growth factors. It was also shown to decrease the proliferation of JAK1/JAK2 expression in mutated cells and induce cell apoptosis.7

Some recent studies have suggested that the S-enantiomer in fact has an inhibiting effect on the R-enantiomer, reducing its biological activity substantially and actually adding to oxidative stress rather than reducing it. Furthermore, the S-enantiomer has been found to reduce the expression of GLUT-4s in cells, responsible for glucose uptake, and hence reduce insulin sensitivity.

In addition to the above, other mechanisms of action of donepezil are possible, including the opposition of glutamate-induced excitatory transmission via downregulation of NMDA receptors and the regulation of amyloid proteins, which have demonstrated significant effects on the disease process of Alzheimer's.8,12,17 Other possible targets for donepezil may also include the inhibition various inflammatory signaling pathways, exerting neuroprotective effects.10,14

Paramagnetic agents have unpaired electrons that generate a magnetic field about 700 times larger than the proton's field, thus disturbing the proton's local magnetic field. When the local magnetic field around a proton is disturbed its relaxation process is altered. MR images are based on proton density and proton relaxation dynamics. MR instruments can record two different relaxation processes, the T1 (spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation time) and T2 (spin-spin or transverse relaxation time). In MRI, visualization of normal and pathological brain tissue depends in part on variations in the radiofrequency signal intensity that occur with changes in proton density, alteration of the T1, and variation in T2. When placed in a magnetic field, gadoteridol shortens the T1 relaxation time in tissues where it accumulates. Gadoteridol does not cross the intact blood-brain barrier; therefore, it does not accumulate in normal brain tissue or in central nervous system (CNS) lesions that have not caused an abnormal blood-brain barrier (e.g., cysts, mature post-operative scars). Abnormal vascularity or disruption of the blood-brain barrier allows accumulation of gadoteridol in lesions such as neoplasms, abscesses, and subacute infarcts."

The activity of PI3K gamma and delta is restricted to hematopoietic cells and it is necessary for normal B cell development. In lymphomas, the activation of PI3K is enlarged to promote unlimited growth and survival. Hence, inhibition of PI3K can provide an inhibition of the signaling from BCR, inhibition of a cytokine signaling from the microenvironment and enhancement of anti-tumor immunity.4 The specific mechanism of this PI3K inhibitors are further described as follows:
-BCR activates signaling pathways after antigen engagement and it is also critical for the physiologic life of the lymphocytes and neoplastic lymphomas. In CLL, BCR reacts to auto- and exo-antigens to promote clonal expansion. This sustained presence of BCR activates delta PI3K producing a pro-survival pathway of the neoplastic cells which already present a higher activity of PI3K. Thus, the blockade of PI3K will limit the activity of BCR and the driven physiology of the lymphoma.4
-The inhibition of PI3K can also inhibit paracrine and autocrine pro-survival signals mediated by adhesion molecules, chemokines and soluble factors. This activity is attained due to the fact that several downstream signals convey on PI3K.5
-It has been reported that inactivation of PI3K produces a significant resistance to tumorigenesis. This data suggests that inhibition of PI3K can facilitate recognition and elimination of tumor cells.4
In summary, duvelisib inhibits the isoform delta of PI3K which is necessary for cell proliferation and survival and the isoform gamma which is critical for cytokine signaling and the pro-inflammatory response.5

The major metabolites of malathion are mono- and di-carboxylic acid derivatives, and malaoxon is a minor metabolite. However, it is malaoxon that is the strongest cholinesterase inhibitor. Cholinesterases catalyze the hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into choline and acetic acid, a reaction necessary to allow a cholinergic neuron to return to its resting state after activation. Because of its essential function, chemicals that interfere with the action of cholinesterase are potent neurotoxins, causing muscle spasms and ultimately death.

As neutrophils promote both the initiation and the maintenance of inflammation at sites of infection, suppressed neutrophil responses lead to extreme susceptibility to infection.2 Low neutrophil levels, or neutropenia, caused by chronic neutropenia, myelosuppressive chemotherapy, and radiation therapy increases the risk of infection and related events.4 Neutropenia caused by chemotherapy or radiation therapy can further progress into febrile neutropenia, which is associated with an elevated risk for life-threatening systemic infections and chemotherapy-associated morbidity and mortality.1
The production and release of functional neutrophils from the bone marrow are normally regulated by granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSF), which are major cytokine regulators of neutrophilic granulocytes.2 G-CSFs act on hematopoietic cells by binding to specific cell surface receptors to stimulate the proliferation‚ differentiation‚ and maturation of neutrophil progenitors. G-CSF also induces some end-cell functional activation of neutrophils, including enhanced phagocytic ability‚ priming of the cellular metabolism associated with respiratory burst‚ antibody-dependent killing, and the increased expression of some cell surface antigens.8 Filgrastim is a short-acting recombinant G-CSF that mimics the biological actions of endogenous G-CSF. It also facilitates the release of neutrophils from the bone marrow into the blood to reduce the incidence of infection and manage neutropenia.3,4

It is well established that M3 receptors exist on the smooth muscle layer throughout the gut and acetylcholine (ACh) released from enteric nerve endings stimulates the contraction of smooth muscle through M3 receptors. The enzyme AChE hydrolyses the released ACh, inactivates it and thus inhibits the gastric motility leading to various digestive disorders. Besides ACh, dopamine is present in significant amounts in the gastrointestinal tract and has several inhibitory effects on gastrointestinal motility, including reduction of lower esophageal sphincter and intragastric pressure. These effects appear to result from suppression of ACh release from the myenteric motor neurons and are mediated by the D2 subtype of dopamine receptors. Itopride, by virtue of its dopamine D2 receptor antagonism, removes the inhibitory effects on Ach release. It also inhibits the enzyme AchE which prevents the degradation of ACh. The net effect is an increase in ACh concentration, which in turn, promotes gastric motility, increases the lower esophageal sphincter pressure, accelerates gastric emptying and improves gastro-duodenal coordination. This dual mode of action of Itopride is unique and different from the actions of other prokinetic agents available in the market.

In aerobic bacteria, azelaic acid reversibly inhibits several oxidoreductive enzymes including tyrosinase, mitochondrial enzymes of the respiratory chain, thioredoxin reductase, 5-alpha-reductase, and DNA polymerases. In anaerobic bacteria, azelaic acid impedes glycolysis. Along with these actions, azelaic acid also improves acne vulgaris by normalizing the keratin process and decreasing microcomedo formation. Azelaic acid may be effective against both inflamed and noninflamed lesions. Specifically, azelaic acid reduces the thickness of the stratum corneum, shrinks keratohyalin granules by reducing the amount and distribution of filaggrin (a component of keratohyalin) in epidermal layers, and lowers the number of keratohyalin granules.

Rb is a tumor suppressant protein that inhibits proliferation through binding to and suppressing the activity of the E2F family of transcription factors 1. However, phosphorylation of Rb relieves suppression of E2F to allow expression of genes required for passage through the restriction point 1. This leads to increased expression of downstream signalling molecules and activity of protein kinases that promote the cell cycle progression and initiation of DNA replication. Phosphorylation of Rb and other proteins by CDK4/6 additionally leads to transcription of genes involved in cell cycle-independent activities including signal transduction, DNA repair transcriptional control, and mRNA processing 1. 
Abemaciclib selectively inhibits CDK4 and CDK6 with low nanomolar potency, inhibits Rb phosphorylation resulting in a G1 arrest and inhibition of proliferation, and its activity is specific for Rb-proficient cells 1. Unlike other CDK inhibitors such as Palbociclib and Ribociclib, abemaciclib exhibits greater selectivity for CDK4 compared to CDK6 2.

This metabolite inhibits DNA synthesis through an inhibitory action on ribonucleotide reductase, and by terminating DNA chain elongation and inhibiting repair through competitive inhibition of DNA polymerases. This leads to the depletion of the intracellular deoxynucleotide triphosphate pool and the self-potentiation of clofarabine triphosphate incorporation into DNA, thereby intensifying the effectiveness of DNA synthesis inhibition. The affinity of clofarabine triphosphate for these enzymes is similar to or greater than that of deoxyadenosine triphosphate. In preclinical models, clofarabine has demonstrated the ability to inhibit DNA repair by incorporation into the DNA chain during the repair process. Clofarabine 5'-triphosphate also disrupts the integrity of mitochondrial membrane, leading to the release of the pro-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins, cytochrome C and apoptosis-inducing factor, leading to programmed cell death.

Topoisomerase I relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single strand breaks. Topotecan binds to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevents religation of these single strand breaks. This ternary complex interferes with the moving replication fork, which leads to the induction of replication arrest and lethal double-stranded breaks in DNA. As mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double strand breaks, the formation of this ternary complex eventually leads to apoptosis (programmed cell death).
Topotecan mimics a DNA base pair and binds at the site of DNA cleavage by intercalating between the upstream (-1) and downstream (+1) base pairs. Intercalation displaces the downstream DNA, thus preventing religation of the cleaved strand. By specifically binding to the enzyme–substrate complex, Topotecan acts as an uncompetitive inhibitor.

In result, the LDL receptors are not able to recycle to the plasma membrane, reducing their binding to LDL-C and therefore reducing the clearance of LDL-C from plasma. Therefore by inhibiting PCSK9's actions, alirocumab allows for more LDL-C reuptake by the liver and facilitates a higher rate of clearance.

Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) resulting from increased resistance to aqueous humor outflow is considered a major risk for the development and progression of POAG, but various clinical studies have demonstrated that the reduction and tight control of IOP can delay or prevent POAG and the vision loss associated with it. Ordinary physiological IOP results from aqueous humor produced by the ocular ciliary body and its outflow through two main outflow pathways: the conventional (trabecular) and the unconventional (uveoscleral) pathways 2.
Under ordinary physiological conditions, diagnostic tracers have shown that the conventional trabecular pathway accounts for up to 90% of aqueous humor outflow. Through this pathway, aqueous humor drains from the anterior chamber sequentially through the uveal and corneoscleral meshwork beams, juxtacanalicular connective tissue (JCT) region, and inner wall (IW) endothelial cells of Schlemm's canal (SC) until finally entering the lumen of SC. From there aqueous humor drains into the collector channels, intravascular plexus, epscleral veins, and finally into the blood circulation 2.
In glaucomatous eyes, elevated IOP is the result of abnormally increased resistance to aqueous outflow in the conventional trabecular pathway due to apparent increases in the contractile tone and stiffness of the trabecular pathway meshwork (TM), changes in extracellular matrix composition, and/or a decrease in the conductance of the IW endothelial cells of SC 2.
Subsequently, as a rho kinase inhibitor, the novelty of netarsudil lies in its ability or specificity to apply its mechanism of action directly and specifically at the diseased TM of the conventional trabecular outflow pathway. In particular, rho kinases are serine/threonine kinases that function as important downstream effectors of Rho GTPase. Such activity in the TM and SC drives actomysin contraction, promotes extracellular matrix production, and increases cell stiffness. Acting as an inhibitor of rho kinase, netarsudil consequently reduces cell contraction, decreases the expression of fibrosis-related proteins, and reduces cell stiffness in the TM and SC cells. As a result, netarsudil has been able to demonstrate increases in trabecular outflow facility, increases in the effective filtration area of the TM, cause expansion of the TM tissue, and dilate episcleral veins 1,2.
Furthermore, netarsudil is also believed to possess inhibitory action against the norepinephrine transporter (NET). Such inhibition of the NET prevents reuptake of norepinephrine at noradrenergic synapses, which results in an increase in the strength and duration of endogenous norepinephrine signaling. As a consequence of this enhanced signaling, norepinephrine-induced vasoconstriction that can reduce blood flow to the ciliary body may subsequently be responsible for a mechanism in which the formation of aqueous humor may be delayed, prolonged, or reduced as well 1.

PCSK9 is a serine protease produced by the liver which binds LDL receptors and creates a complex to be targeted for lysosomal degradation. LDL receptors typically bind LDL-cholesterol (\bad\ cholesterol) for cellular reuptake, therefore the formation of these complexes with PCSK9 inhibits LDL receptor recycling to the cell surface, resulting in decreased cellular reuptake of LDL-C and increased levels of free LDL-C in the plasma. Individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia often may have \gain of function\ mutations in the PCSK9 molecules in their body, resulting in increased LDL-C plasma levels and a consequent cardiovascular risk. Evolocumab is able to bind both the normal PCSK9 and the \gain of function\ mutant, D374Y. The exact mechanism of the binding has not been published, however the precursor molecule, mAb1, is indicative of the interaction. The mAb1 molecule binds on the catalytic site of PCSK9 next to the binding site for the LDL receptor and creates hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, resulting in the steric inhibition of binding between PCSK9 and the LDL receptor. Because the formation of complexes between LDL receptor and PCSK9 are prevented, the internalized LDL receptors are less likely to be degrated by lysosomes and may recycle to the surface of the cell to serve their function of removing LDL from the blood.

Using in vitro assays and studies in transgenic animal models of SMA, nusinersen was shown to increase exon 7 inclusion in SMN2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) transcripts and production of full-length SMN protein.
Nusinersen acts to replace the SMN protein deficit which causes SMA, by increasing the splicing efficiency of the SMN2 pre- mRNA. More specifically, nusinersen in an 18-mer 2’-MOE phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotide that acts as a splice-altering oligonucleotide. Nusinersen was designed to pair with a specific target sequence on the SMN2 pre-mRNA to displace heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) at the intronic splice silencing site-1 (ISS-1) between exons 7 and 8 to allow for more complete translation of SMN protein from the paralogous gene SMN2.
Further reinforcing this concept, SMA phenotype is closely tied to SMN2 copy number. SMN2 serves to produce SMN protein, however at a greatly reduced rate because of differential splicing caused by the binding of the hnRNPs at the ISS-1.

It binds to the human growth hormone receptor (GHR), which is a dimeric receptor expressed in target cells in the liver and cartilage.7 Upon binding of growth hormone, GHR dimerizes and interacts with Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), subsequently leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and the GH receptor.

The antiinflammatory actions of glucocorticoids are thought to involve phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, lipocortins, which control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Ciclesonide reduces inflammatory reaction by limiting the capillary dilatation and permeability of the vascular structures. These compounds restrict the accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages and reduce the release of vasoactive kinins. Recent research suggests that corticosteroids may inhibit the release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids, thereby reducing the formation of prostaglandins. Ciclesonide is a glucocorticoid receptor agonist. On binding, the corticoreceptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing an increase or decrease in expression of specific target genes, including suppression of IL2 (interleukin 2) expression.

Mutations in the BRAF gene, including BRAF V600E, result in activated BRAF kinases that mahy stimulate tumor cell growth. Encorafenib is able to bind to other kinases in vitro including JNK1, JNK2, JNK3, LIMK1, LIMK2, MEK4, and STK36 and significantly reduce ligand binding to these kinases at clinically achievable concentrations (= 0.9 µM).8
In efficacy studies, encorafenib inhibited the in vitro cell growth of tumor cell lines that express BRAF V600 E, D, and K mutations. In mice implanted with tumor cells expressing the BRAF V600E mutation, encorafenib induced tumor regressions associated with RAF/MEK/ERK pathway suppression.8
Encorafenib and binimetinib target two different kinases in the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. Compared with either drug alone, co-administration of encorafenib and binimetinib result in greater anti-proliferative activity in vitro in BRAF mutation-positive cell lines and greater anti-tumor activity with respect to tumor growth inhibition in BRAF V600E mutant human melanoma xenograft studies in mice. In addition to the above, the combination of encorafenib and binimetinib acted to delay the emergence of resistance in BRAF V600E mutant human melanoma xenografts in mice compared with the administration of either drug alone.8

Fludrocortisone binding to mineralocorticoid receptors causes alterations to DNA transcription and translation of proteins that result in an increased density of sodium channels on the apical side of renal tubule cells and an increased density of Na+-K+-ATPase on the basolateral side.13 These increases in receptor density result in increased plasma sodium concentrations, and thus increased blood pressure, as well as a decreased plasma potassium concentration. Fludrocortisone may also exert a direct effect on plasma sodium levels via action at the Na+-H+ exchanger found in the apical membrane of renal tubule cells.13
Fludrocortisone also acts on glucocorticoid receptors, albeit with a much lower affinity - the glucocorticoid potency of fludrocortisone is approximately 5-10 times that of endogenous cortisol, whereas its mineralocorticoid potency is 200-400 times greater.7

The HIV-1 protease enzyme, a dimeric aspartic protease, is the enzyme responsible for cleaving the Gag polyprotein and thus plays a critical role in many aspects of the HIV viral lifecycle.4
Saquinavir is an inhibitor of the HIV-1 protease enzyme.6 Its design is based on the \peptidomimetic\ principle, wherein the molecule contains a hydroxyethylene scaffold that mimics the normal peptide linkage (cleaved by HIV protease) but which itself cannot be cleaved.5 By preventing HIV-1 protease activity, and thus the proteolysis of the Gag polyprotein, saquinavir results in the production of immature, non-infectious viral particles.

Its combination of orthosteric and allosteric activity on SERT allows for greater extracellular 5-HT levels, a faster onset of action, and greater efficacy as compared to other SSRIs. 16,13 The sustained elevation of synaptic 5-HT eventually causes desensitization of 5-HT1A auto-receptors, which normally shut down endogenous 5-HT release in the presence of excess 5-HT - this desensitization may be necessary for the full clinical effect of SSRIs and may be responsible for their typically prolonged onset of action.17,13
Escitalopram has shown little-to-no binding affinity at a number of other receptors, such as histamine and muscarinic receptors, and minor activity at these off-targets may explain some of its adverse effects.18,19,20,13

As a result of the above cascade of effects, mycophenolate mofetil reduces de-novo production of guanosine nucleotides, interfering with the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein required for immune cell production.6 Further contributing to the above anti-inflammatory effects, MMF depletes tetrahydrobiopterin, causing the decreased function of inducible nitric oxide synthase enzyme, in turn decreasing the production of peroxynitrite, a molecule that promotes inflammation.12

Pain signals are then further transmitted via second-order ascending neurons to the brainstem, hypothalamus, and thalamic nuclei, and from there to several cortical regions (e.g. auditory, visual, motor cortices).2 The trigeminal ganglion appears to amplify and perpetuate the migraine headache pain through the activation of perivascular fibers and the release of molecules involved in pain generation, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP).2
The a-isoform of CGRP, expressed in primary sensory neurons, is a potent vasodilator and has been implicated in migraine pathogenesis - CGRP levels are acutely elevated during migraine attacks, return to normal following treatment with triptan medications, and intravenous infusions of CGRP have been shown to trigger migraine-like headaches in migraine patients. In addition to its vasodilatory properties, CGRP appears to be a pronociceptive factor that modulates neuronal excitability to facilitate pain responses.3
Rimegepant is an antagonist of the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor1 - it competes with CGRP for occupancy at these receptors, preventing the actions of CGRP and its ability to amplify and perpetuate migraine headache pain, ultimately terminating the headache.3

Light activation of verteporfin results in local damage to neovascular endothelium, resulting in vessel occlusion. Damaged endothelium is known to release procoagulant and vasoactive factors through the lipo-oxygenase (leukotriene) and cyclo-oxygenase (eicosanoids such as thromboxane) pathways, resulting in platelet aggregation, fibrin clot formation and vasoconstriction. Verteporfin appears to somewhat preferentially accumulate in neovasculature, including choroidal neovasculature. However, animal models indicate that the drug is also present in the retina.

The end result of these processes is a decrease in prostate cancer cell proliferation and tumor size.6 Its main metabolite, keto-darolutamide, shows similar pharmacological activity to the parent drug, darolutamide.4,6 Darolutamide has been found to bind more tightly to the AR receptor than apalutamide and enzalutamide, which are other androgen receptor antagonists.3,5
Darolutamide can act as a progesterone receptor (PR) antagonist in the laboratory setting with approximately 1% activity when compared to its actions at the androgen receptor. The clinical relevance is not known at this time.6

In patients with HAE, they have an absent or dysfunctional C1-esterase inhibitor. This inhibitor is responsible for the production of bradykinin in which displacement of bradykinin from B2 receptors by icatibant has an inhibitory effect on the receptor for a relatively long time.

Subsequently, because factor VIII is a critical component that is essential for the extrinsic tissue factor pathway of the blood coagulation cascade process to proceed, individuals with hemophilia A ultimately experience increased bleeding - in comparison to individuals without a factor VIII deficiency - after injury or any kind of medical procedure 5. Such increased bleeding can be heavy and/or fatal and may occur due to minimal injury or even when there is no injury whatsoever - in which case the bleeding is spontaneous 5. Furthermore, excessive bleeds that bleed into muscles, organs, and joints are also associated with dangerous complications and regular pain 5.
The turoctocog alfa pegol (N8-GP) drug is consequently recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) in which specific site-directed glycoPEGylation has been performed in an effort to increase the half-life of the rFVIII moiety without altering its hemostatic activity 1,2. In particular, the general rFVIII component of N8-GP is turoctocog alfa, a human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), with a truncated B-domain 1,2. This glycoprotein has the same structure as human clotting factor VIII when activated, and also possesses post-translational modifications that are similar to those of the plasma-derived molecule 1,2.
In blood, factor VIII predominantly circulates in a stable non-covalent complex with von Willebrand factor (vWF) 3,6. Concurrently, the tyrosine sulfation site present at the Tyr1680 (native full length) position, which is important for binding to vWF, has been found to be fully sulfated in the turoctocog alfa molecule 1,2. Subsequently, when infused into a hemophilia patient, this rFVIII binds to endogenous vWF in the patient’s circulation 1,2. The resultant factor VIII/vWF complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and vWF) with different physiological functions 1,2,3,6. Factor VIII is activated by thrombin (factor IIa) 1,2,5. Activated factor VIII acts as a co-factor for activated factor IX, accelerating the conversion of factor X to activated factor X 5. Activated factor X converts prothrombin into thrombin 5. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed 5. Turoctocog alfa pegol consequently functions predominantly as factor VIII replacement therapy for patients with factor VIII deficient hemophilia A. 
Finally, the particular N8-GP molecule has a 40-kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG) attached to a specific O-glycan in the truncated B-domain of the general turoctocog alfa rFVIII structure 1,2. Upon activation by thrombin, this B-domain possessing the pegylation is cleaved away, leaving active rFVIIIa - which as discussed above, is highly similar to and elicits the same blood clotting activities as native factor VIII 1,2. Subsequently, the PEG group of N8-GP ultimately serves to extend the half-life of the overall drug molecule in the body. As an inert chemical, the PEG group prolongs N8-GP's half-life by acting like an obstructive 'cloud' around the rFVIII molecule to which it is attached 13. Since the PEG group is generally too large to be cleared by the kidneys and does not bind particularly well with the clearance receptors that typically eliminate endogenous factor VIII, N8-GP demonstrates a longer half-life than the general turoctocog alfa rFVIII structure 13.

When entacapone is given in conjunction with levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor, such as carbidopa, plasma levels of levodopa are greater and more sustained than after administration of levodopa and an aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor alone. It is believed that at a given frequency of levodopa administration, these more sustained plasma levels of levodopa result in more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain, leading to a greater reduction in the manifestations of parkinsonian syndrome.

Upon interaction of cytokines with their cytokine receptors, the JAKs mediate the JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway in response to receptor activation. JAKs are tyrosine kinases that cause phosphorylation of several proteins, including cytokine receptors and JAKs themselves. Phosphorylation of JAKs promotes the phosphorylation and activation of the signalling molecules called STATs, leading to their nuclear translocation, binding to DNA promoters, and target gene transcription. JAK1-mediated signalling pathways ultimately promote pro-inflammatory events, such as increased proliferation and survival of immune cells, T cell differentiation, and macrophage activation.5 Upadacitinib is a selective JAK1 inhibitor that has a negligible effect on JAK3, leading to an improved drug safety profile.4 Upadacitinib blocks the cellular processes that contribute to the inflammatory conditions in rheumatoid arthritis. In human leukocytes cellular assays, upadacitinib inhibited JAK1/3-induced phosphorylation of STAT3/5 mediated by IL-6/7.9

Paramagnetic agents have unpaired electrons that generate a magnetic field about 700 times larger than the proton's field, thus disturbing the proton's local magnetic field. When the local magnetic field around a proton is disturbed, its relaxation process is altered. MR images are based on proton density and proton relaxation dynamics. MR instruments can record 2 different relaxation processes, the T1 (spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation time) and the T2 (spin-spin or transverse relaxation time). In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), visualization of normal and pathological brain tissue depends in part on variations in the radiofrequency signal intensity that occur with changes in proton density, alteration of the T1, and variation in the T2. When placed in a magnetic field, gadodiamide shortens both the T1 and the T2 relaxation times in tissues where it accumulates. At clinical doses, gadodiamide primarily affects the T1 relaxation time, thus producing an increase in signal intensity. Gadodiamide does not cross the intact blood-brain barrier; therefore, it does not accumulate in normal brain tissue or in central nervous system (CNS) lesions that have not caused an abnormal blood-brain barrier (e.g., cysts, mature post-operative scars). Abnormal vascularity or disruption of the blood-brain barrier allows accumulation of gadodiamide in lesions such as neoplasms, abscesses, and subacute infarcts."

As abovementioned, olanzapine presents a wide profile of targets, however, its antagonistic effect towards the dopamine D2 receptor in the mesolimbic pathway is key as it blocks dopamine from having a potential action at the post-synaptic receptor. The binding of olanzapine to the dopamine D2 receptors is easily dissociable and hence, it allows for a certain degree of dopamine neurotransmission.6
On the other hand, olanzapine acts in the serotonin 5HT2A receptors in the frontal cortex in a similar manner than the reported on dopamine D2 receptors. This determined effect allows for a decrease in adverse effects.6

Type 1 interferon pathway activation has been identified as a mediator of pathogenesis in SLE, and the level of type 1 interferon expression is correlated with severity of SLE.4,6,10 Activation of the type 1 interferon receptor (INFAR1) by interferons alpha, beta, epsilon, kappa, and omega lead to stimulation of gene transcription.4 Activation of INFAR1 and INFAR2 lead to phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2, which are translocated with interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) to the cell nucleus to activate the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE).6 Activation of ISRE leads to the expression of many proinflammatory and immunomodulatory proteins, as well as the activation of a positive feedback loop that produces more type 1 interferons.6
Interferon alpha stimulates monocytes to mature into myeloid dendritic cells that express self antigens.10 CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, as well as B cells, that are autoreactive will respond to the self antigens and induce inflammmation and apoptosis in cells.10 This self-reactive immune response damages otherwise healthy tissue throughout the body.10
Anifrolumab is an immunoglobulin gamma 1 kappa (IgG1<U+03BA>) monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to subunit 1 of INFAR1.2,11 The binding of anifrolumab to IFNAR1 inhibits the activity of the receptor, decreasing downstream signalling and gene transcription of inflammatory mediators.4,11
The Fc region of anifrolumab carries the triple mutaion L234F/L235E/P331S to prevent binding of the Fc region of the antibody to cell surface Fc receptors.6
In a phase IIb clinical trial, the primary endpoint was reached by 34.3% of patients in the 300 mg treatment group, 28.8% of patients in the 1000 mg treatment group, and 17.6% of patients in the placebo group.4 Patients with higher interferon-stimulated gene transcription at baseline showed a greater response to treatment.4

The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism. In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR. Reversal of the proline and lysine residues at positions B28 and B29 of native insulin eliminates hydrophobic interactions and weakens some of the hydrogen bonds that contribute to the stability of the insulin dimers that comprise insulin hexamers. Hexamers of insulin lispro are produced in the presence of zinc and m-cresol. These weakly associated hexamers quickly dissociate upon subcutaneous injection and are absorbed as monomers through vascular endothelial cells. These properties give insulin lispro its fast-acting properties.

The main driver mutation, JAK2 V617F, is present in >95% of PV patients and results in constitutive JAK/STAT signalling; other exon 12 mutations in JAK2 may also result in PV. PV results in clonal hematopoietic stem cells, such that they form endogenous erythroid colonies (EECs) in vitro.1
Interferon alfa-2b has been used for decades in PV despite the lack of formal approval.2 Although the mechanism of action is unclear, interferon alfa-2b is known to bind the interferon-alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR) and activate downstream JAK/STAT signalling.2,6 The overall result is a series of anti-proliferative, anti-angiogenic, pro-apoptotic, and immunomodulatory effects, including augmenting T-cell, macrophage, and natural killer cells.2 Interestingly, in vitro studies have revealed that ropeginterferon alfa-2b is specific to some extent for JAK2-mutant EECs, a result that is in line with the reduced allelic burden observed in clinical trials.3,4 Partial and complete molecular and hematological responses have been achieved with ropeginterferon alfa-2b.4

Acquired haemophilia is a rare bleeding disorder where patients with normal Factor VIII genes spontaneously develop inhibitory autoantibodies directed against Factor VIII. These autoantibodies are IgG1 and IgG4 autoantibodies that bind to the A2, A3 and C2 domains of the FVIII molecules to inactivate them 1. The autoantibodies neutralize circulating human factor VIII and create a functional deficiency of this procoagulant protein.

The inhibition of COMT also causes a reduction in circulating 3-OMD as a result of decreased peripheral metabolism of levodopa. This may lead to an increase distribution of levodopa into the CNS through the reduction of its competitive substrate, 3-OMD, for transport mechanisms. Sustained levodopa concentrations presumably result in more consistent dopaminergic stimulation, resulting in greater reduction in the manifestations of parkinsonian syndrome.

In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that atorvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.25 These effects include improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.

The full spectrum of AAV includes granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), and drug-induced AAV. AAV may be associated with necrotizing and crescentic glomerulonephritis (NCGN). Of the various known ANCAs, the major antigens are myeloperoxidase (MPO) and proteinase 3 (PR3/myeloblastin).1,2
The pathophysiology giving rise to AAV is complex, though a working model has been proposed. An initial trigger, such as infection, causes differentiation of naive T cells into TH17 helper T cells that induce the release from macrophages of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-a and IL-1ß), which prime neutrophils. Concurrently, the anaphylatoxin C5a is produced through activation of the alternative complement pathway, which also primes neutrophils through binding to the C5a receptor (C5aR; CD88). Primed neutrophils undergo physiological changes, including upregulating the display of ANCA antigens on their surface. Circulating ANCAs bind to displayed ANCA antigens on the surface of neutrophils; simultaneously, the Fc region of these ANCAs is recognized by Fc<U+03B3> receptors on other neutrophils, resulting in excessive neutrophil activation. Activated neutrophils form NETs (neutrophil extracellular traps), which induce tissue damage and vasculitis. MPO/PR3 in NETs induces further ANCA production through dendritic cell- and CD4+ T cell-mediated activation of B cells, further exacerbating the condition.1,2
A role for complement was not initially considered in AAV due to a lack of excessive complement or immunoglobulin deposition in AAV lesions.2,3 However, extensive molecular studies confirmed a significant role for the alternative complement pathway, acting through C3 and C5, in the pathogenesis of AAV.2,3,4,5 The C5a fragment, generated by C5 cleavage, can bind to both the C5aR and C5a-like receptor (C5L2) on the surface of neutrophils; C5aR binding is associated with AAV while C5L2 binding has a protective effect.4,5 As the alternative complement pathway is self-sustaining in the absence of down-regulation by specific proteins, it is likely a significant driver of AAV. Furthermore, neutrophils activated by C5a release reactive oxygen species, properdin, and other molecules that stimulate the complement pathway leading to the production of more C5a in a vicious cycle.1,2
Avacopan (CCX168) is a specific C5aR receptor allosteric antagonist that inhibits C5a-mediated neutrophil activation both in vitro and in vivo.5,6,7 By inhibiting the C5a/C5aR axis, avacopan should have minimal effects on the formation of the membrane attack complex (which includes C5b) and therefore little effect on the innate immune response in treated patients.2,3

Osteoclasts are a kind of differentiated or specialized bone cell that breaks down bone tissue while osteoblasts are another set of differentiated bone cells that synthesize and rebuild bone tissue. When osteoclasts degrade bone tissue faster than the osteoblasts are capable of rebuilding the bone tissue, low or inadequate bone mass density and osteoperosis can resula One of the mechanisms with which strontium ranelate is thought to act is its functionality as an agonist of the extracellular calcium sensing receptors (CaSRs) 3 of osteoblasts and osteoclasts 2. Ordinary interaction between calcium 2+ divalent cations with mature osteoclast CaSRs is known to induce osteoclast apoptosis. Subsequently, strontium 2+ divalent cations from strontium ranelate use can also bind CaSRs on osteoclasts to induce their apoptosis because of the strontium 2+ cation's close resemeblance to calcium 2+. Contact between extracelluar calcium 2+ and osteoclast CaSRs stimulates the phospholipase C (PLC) dependant breakdown of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) into the two secondary messengers inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). Whereas the calcium-CaSRs interaction then performs IP3 Adependent translocation of nuclear factor NF-kB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in mature osteoclasts, strontium-CaSRs interactions involves a DAG-PKC beta II (protein kinase C beta II) signalling pathway for translocating NF-kB from the cytoplasm to the nucleus in an IP3-independent manner. Although the calcium 2+ and strontium 2+ mediated signalling pathways are different, both CaSR interactions induce osteoclast apoptosis and are in fact capable of potentiating each other, leading to enhanced osteoclast apoptosis and decreased bone tissue degradation 4.
At the same time, given the similarity between the calcium 2+ and strontium 2+ cations, strontium 2+ cations from strontium ranelate are seemingly also able to act as an agonist and stimulate the CaSRs on osteoblasts, possibly in tandem with various local osteoblast stimulatory growth factors like transforming growth factor ß (TGF ß) and/or bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), to stimulate cyclic D genes and early oncogenes like c-fos and egr-1 that can mediate the mitogenesis and proliferation of new or more osteoblasts 5. Moreover, although the involvement of the PLC mediated pathway may be a part of the signalling mechanism in osteoblasts following the stimulation of their CaSRs, this has not yet been fully elucidated 5.
Furthermore, strontium ranelate is also thought to be capable of stimulating osteoblasts to enhance the expression of osteoprotegerin while also concurrently reducing the expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-<U+0392> ligand (RANKL) in primary human osteoblastic cells. As osteoprotegerin can competitively bind to RANKL as a decoy receptor, which can prevent RANKL from binding to RANK, which is an activity that facilitates the signaling pathway for the differentiation and activaiton of osteoclasts. The subsequent net effect of these actions ultiamtely results in decreased osteoclastogenesis. 3
Moreover, bone biopsies obtained from patients treated with stronatium ranelate in clinical study reveal improvements in intrinsic bone tissue quality and microarchitecutre in ostepoerosis as evidenced by increased trabecular number, decreased trabecular separation, lower structure model index, and increased cortical thickness associated with a shift in trabecular structure from rod to plate like configurations compared with control patients 3.
Additionally, strontium from administered strontium ranelate is absorbed onto the crystal surface of treated bones and only slightly substitiutes for calcium in the apatite crystal of newly formed bone. As a result, there is an increased X-ray absorption of strontium as compared to calcium, which can lead to an amplification of bone mineral density (BMD) measurement by dual-proton X-ray absorptiometry. In essence, although strontium ranelate use can increase BMD some of the observations may be overestimations due to skeletal accretion of strontium in strontium ranelate treated patients 3.
Having the ability to both generate more osetoblasts and decrease the number of osteoclasts gives strontium ranelate an apparent dual mechanism of action when used to treat osteoperosis."	"DB09267"	NA	6918182	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

The antiemetic activity of the drug is brought about through the inhibition of 5-HT3 receptors present both centrally (medullary chemoreceptor zone) and peripherally (GI tract). This inhibition of 5-HT3 receptors in turn inhibits the visceral afferent stimulation of the vomiting center, likely indirectly at the level of the area postrema, as well as through direct inhibition of serotonin activity within the area postrema and the chemoreceptor trigger zone. Alternative mechanisms appear to be primarily responsible for delayed nausea and vomiting induced by emetogenic chemotherapy, since similar temporal relationships between between serotonin and emesis beyond the first day after a dose have not been established, and 5-HT3 receptor antagonists generally have not appeared to be effective alone in preventing or ameliorating delayed effects. It has been hypothesized that palonosetron's potency and long plasma half-life may contribute to its observed efficacy in preventing delayed nausea and vomiting caused by moderately emetogenic cancer chemotherapy.

The administration of rIX-RFP increases the plasma concentration of FIX, thus addressing the coagulation deficiency of the patient. rIX-RFP is able to circulate in the plasma as an intact zymogen thanks to the pH-dependent binding to FcRn which is a normal protection pathway from lysosomal degradation of albumin. When the FIX is needed, rAlbumin is cleaved by the same proteases that activate the FIX.1

After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid production. The cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed, potentiating the effect. In other words, the two main products in inflammation Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils, macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding.

It is used together with sodium nitrite for cyanide poisiong as antidote. Cyanide has a very high affinity for iron in the ferric state. It reacts with the trivalent (ferric) iron of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase, thereby inhibiting cellular respiration, resulting in lactic acidosis and cytotoxic hypoxia. Sodium nitrite reacts with hemoglobin to form methemoglobin, which competes with cytochrome oxidase for the cyanide ion. Cyanide binds to methemoglobin to form cyanmethemoglobin and restore the activity of cytochrome oxidase. When cyanide dissociates from methemoglobin, sodium thiosulfate facilitates its conversion by rhodanese to thiocyanate, a less toxic ion.

In particular, the lidocaine agent acts on sodium ion channels located on the internal surface of nerve cell membranes 10,7,8. At these channels, neutral uncharged lidocaine molecules diffuse through neural sheaths into the axoplasm where they are subsequently ionized by joining with hydrogen ions 10,7,8. The resultant lidocaine cations are then capable of reversibly binding the sodium channels from the inside, keeping them locked in an open state that prevents nerve depolarization 10,7,8. As a result, with sufficient blockage, the membrane of the postsynaptic neuron will ultimately not depolarize and will thus fail to transmit an action potential 10,7,8. This facilitates an anesthetic effect by not merely preventing pain signals from propagating to the brain but by aborting their generation in the first place 10,7,8.
In addition to blocking conduction in nerve axons in the peripheral nervous system, lidocaine has important effects on the central nervous system and cardiovascular system 10,7,8. After absorption, lidocaine may cause stimulation of the CNS followed by depression and in the cardiovascular system, it acts primarily on the myocardium where it may produce decreases in electrical excitability, conduction rate, and force of contraction 10,7,8.

These include vasoconstriction, stimulation and synthesis of aldosterone and ADH, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium among others. Overall, valsartan's physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. 
Valsartan also affects the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and prevent ventricular hypertrophy.5
The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) class of medications (which includes drugs such as ramipril, lisinopril, and perindopril) inhibits the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II by inhibiting the ACE enzyme but does not prevent the formation of all angiotensin II. ARB activity is unique in that it blocks all angiotensin II activity, regardless of where or how it was synthesized. 
Valsartan is commonly used for the management of hypertension, heart failure, and type 2 diabetes-associated nephropathy, particularly in patients who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors. ARBs such as valsartan have been shown in a number of large-scale clinical outcomes trials to improve cardiovascular outcomes including reducing risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, the progression of heart failure, and hospitalization.1,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 Valsartan also slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy due to its renoprotective effects.6,7,8 Improvements in chronic kidney disease with valsartan include both clinically and statistically significant decreases in urinary albumin and protein excretion in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and in nondiabetic patients diagnosed with chronic kidney disease.1,10
Valsartan also binds to the AT2 receptor, however AT2 is not known to be associated with cardiovascular homeostasis like AT1. Valsartan has about 20,000-fold higher affinity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor. The increased plasma levels of angiotensin II following AT1 receptor blockade with valsartan may stimulate the unblocked AT2 receptor.18

Inhibition of CA in the ciliary process of the eye slows the formation of bicarbonate, and reduces sodium and fluid transport. This results in a reduction in the rate of aqueous humor secretion and the intraocular pressure. Brinzolamide is absorbed systemically following topical ocular administration. Since it has a high affinity for CA-II, brinzolamide binds extensively to red blood cells, where CA-II is primarily found. As sufficient CA-II activity remains, adverse effects resulting from the systemic inhibition of CA by brinzolamide are not observed. The metabolite N-desethyl brinzolamide is also formed. This metabolite binds to CA and accumulates in red blood cells as well. In the presence of brinzolamide, the metabolite binds mainly to carbonic anhydrase I (CA-I).

Migraine attacks are generally divided into phases: the premonitory phase, which typically involves irritability, fatigue, yawning, and stiff neck; the headache phase, which lasts for between four and 72 hours; and the postdrome phase, which lasts for up to a day following resolution of pain and whose symptoms are similar to those of the premonitory phase. In addition, neurological deficits, collectively termed migraine aura, may precede the headache phase.4,3
The underlying pathophysiology of migraines is a matter of active research but involves both neurological and vascular components. The head pain associated with migraine is thought to be a consequence of activation of the nociceptive nerves comprising the trigeminocervical complex (TCC).3 Terminals of nociceptive nerves that innervate the dura matter release vasoactive peptides, such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), resulting in cranial vasodilation. Finally, when present, migraine aura appears to correlate with a transient wave(s) of cortical depolarization, termed cortical spreading depression (CSD).3,6
Triptans, including zolmitriptan, are proposed to act in three ways. The main mechanism is through modulation of nociceptive nerve signalling in the central nervous system through 5-HT1B/1D receptors throughout the TCC and associated areas of the brain. In addition, triptans can enhance vasoconstriction, both through direct 5-HT1B-mediated dilation of cranial blood vessels,1,8 as well as through 5-HT1D-mediated suppression of CGRP release.3,14
Although triptans are classically described solely in terms of their effects on 5-HT1B/1D receptors, they also act as 5-HT1F agonists as well. This 5-HT subtype is also found throughout the TCC, but is not present appreciably in cerebral vasculature; the significance of triptan-mediated 5-HT1F activation is currently not well described.2 Additionally, CSD that initiates in the ipsilateral parietal region may exert its effects in a manner that relies on 5-HT1B/1D receptor activation, suggesting that triptans may have some effect on CSD-mediated symptoms.3,7

In the natural setting, i.e. with sexual stimulation, it restores impaired erectile function by increasing blood flow to the penis 5,12,13,16,8.
The physiological mechanism responsible for the erection of the penis involves the release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum during sexual stimulation 5,12,13,16,8. Nitric oxide then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), producing smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum and allowing inflow of blood 5,12,13,16,8.
Sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) in the corpus cavernosum, where PDE5 is responsible for degradation of cGMP 5,12,13,16,8. Sildenafil has a peripheral site of action on erections 5,12,13,16,8. Sildenafil has no direct relaxant effect on isolated human corpus cavernosum but potently enhances the relaxant effect of NO on this tissue 5,12,13,16,8. When the NO/cGMP pathway is activated, as occurs with sexual stimulation, inhibition of PDE5 by sildenafil results in increased corpus cavernosum levels of cGMP 5,12,13,16,8. Therefore sexual stimulation is required in order for sildenafil to produce its intended beneficial pharmacological effects 5,12,13,16,8.
Moreover, apart from the presence of PDE5 in the corpus cavernosum of the penis, PDE5 is also present in the pulmonary vasculature 4,11,14,15,9. Sildenafil, therefore, increases cGMP within pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells resulting in relaxation 4,11,14,15,9. In patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, this can lead to vasodilation of the pulmonary vascular bed and, to a lesser degree, vasodilatation in the systemic circulation 4,11,14,15,9.

These structural features contribute to the formation of a curved dimer in which most amino acid side chains are located on the convex surface. The dimer orients itself at the membrane-water interface on bacterial cells with the relatively hydrophilic back-bone on the concave side facing the external environment and the many hydrophobic side chains on the convex side facing into the cell's lipid bilayer. The tyrocidine dimer is able to disrupt the cell membrane producing leakage of cell contents but the exact mechanism of this permeabilization is unclear.
Tyrocidines appear to act as reversible non-competitive inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase and ß-galactosidase 4. The relation of this to their antibacterial action is unknown.
Gramcidins adopt similar ß-sheet structures but are capable of forming ß-helices 5. They can either form a double helix, running either parallel or anti-parallel, or a helical dimer wherein the N-termini of each polypeptide meets in the middle of the lipid bilayer. The alternating L and D amino acid structure allows the hydrophobic side chains to point outwards into the lipid bilayer, leaving the more hydrophilic backbone to form the lumen of the pore. The carbonyl oxygen atoms aid in the transport of cations through the pore. In both double helix and helical dimer conformations, gramcidins are capable of transporting monovalent cations through the membrane. Divalent cations result in blockage of the pore or channel when bound. Loss of potassium ions through membrane permeabilization seems to inhibit bacterial growth.
Gramcidin also appears to be able to insert into the mitochondial membrane and conduct hydrogen ions 6. This results in an uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation from ATP generation due to the loss of the hydrogen ion gradient necessary for H+ATPase function.

This stabilizes the calcium-induced conformational change of troponin C, thereby (1) changing actin-myosin cross-bridge kinetics apparently without increasing the cycling rate of the cross-bridges or myocardial ATP consumption, (2) increasing the effects of calcium on cardiac myofilaments during systole and (3) improving contraction at low energy cost (inotropic effect). Calcium concentration and, therefore, sensitization decline during diastole, allowing normal or improved diastolic relaxation. Levosimendan also leads to vasodilation through the opening of ATP-sensitive potassium channels. By these inotropic and vasodilatory actions, levosimendan increases cardiac output without increasing myocardial oxygen demand. Levosimendan also has a selective phosphodiesterase (PDE)-III inhibitory action that may contribute to the inotropic effect of this compound under certain experimental conditions. It has been reported that levosimendan may act preferentially as a Ca2+ sensitizer at lower concentrations, whereas at higher concentrations its action as a PDE-III inhibitor becomes more prominent in experimental animals and humans.

In atrial fibrillation, tachyarrhythmia, or fast heart rate, can either be paroxysmal (less than 7 days) or persistent (more than 7 days). Atrial fibrillation causes turbulent and abnormal blood flow through the heart chambers, leading to decreased the effectiveness of the heart to pump blood and an increased likelihood of thrombus formation within the atria which can ultimately dislodge and cause a stroke.12
Dronedarone achieves heart rate and rhythm control in atrial fibrillation. In vitro, dronedarone decreased the maximum rate of the rise of an action potential in a concentration- and frequency-dependent manner.2 Cardiac action potentials are generated by ionic currents of multiple voltage-gated ion channels, including potassium, sodium, and calcium channels.6 Dronedarone is a multichannel blocker that meets the criteria of all four Vaughan Williams antiarrhythmic drug classes1 but the contribution of each of these activities to the drug's antiarrhythmic effect is unknown.13 Dronedarone inhibits rapid Na+ currents rate-dependently (class Ib), non-competitively antagonizes a– and ß-adrenergic receptors (class II), blocks K+ outward currents (class III) and blocks slow Ca2+ inward currents (class IV).1 More specifically, it decreases delayed-rectifier K+ current (IKr), slowly activating delayed-rectifier K+ current (IKs), inward rectifier potassium current (IK1), peak Na+ current (INa) and L-type Ca2+ current (ICa (L)).2,3 Dronedarone ultimately increases refractory periods, decelerates cardiac conduction, and prolongs cardiac action potential and refractory periods.1,9

Subsequently, relapse is common in MCL patients and ultimately represents disease progression 4.
Lymphoma occurs when immune system lymphocytes grow and multiply uncontrollably. Such cancerous lymphocytes may travel to many parts of the body, including the lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, blood, and other organs where they can multiply and form a mass(es) called a tumor. One of the main kinds of lymphocytes that can develop into cancerous lymphomas are the body's own B-lymphocytes (B-cells) 4.
Bruton Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) is a signalling molecule of the B-cell antigen receptor and cytokine receptor pathways. Such BTK signaling causes the activation of pathways necessary for B-cell proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion.6
Acalabrutinib is a small molecule inhibitor of BTK. Both acalabrutinib and its active metabolite, ACP-5862, act to form a covalent bond with a cysteine residue (Cys481) in the BTK active site, leading to inhibition of BTK enzymatic activity.2,4 As a result, acalabrutinib inhibits BTK-mediated activation of downstream signaling proteins CD86 and CD69, which ultimately inhibits malignant B-cell proliferation and survival4
Whereas ibrutinib is typically recognized as the first-in-class BTK inhibitor,2 acalabrutinib is considered a second generation BTK inhibitor primarily because it demonstrates highter selectivity and inhibition of the targeted activity of BTK while having a much greater IC50 or otherwise virtually no inhibition on the kinase activities of ITK, EGFR, ERBB2, ERBB4, JAK3, BLK, FGR, FYN, HCK, LCK, LYN, SRC, and YES1.2
In effect, acalabrutinib was rationally designed to be more potent and selective than ibrutinib, all the while demonstrating fewer adverse effects - in theory - because of the drug's minimized off target effects.

Once processed the siRNA can bind to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). RISC separates the strands of the RNA sequence. One strand is released and one remains bound. The bound strand then acts as a targeting sequence for a complimentary mRNA sequence. In this case, the bound strand of patisiran binds to the complimentary transthyretin mRNA and aligns the RISC complex with it. The transthyretin mRNA is then cleaved and rendered non-functional.

However, tumours often evade T cell-mediated immune responses to enhance their survival.4 Inflammatory mediators, such as IFN-gamma, induce the expression of programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1), which is a type 1 transmembrane protein expressed on tumour cells and tumour-associated immune cells in the tumour microenvironment.2,7 PD-L1 acts as an immune checkpoint to regulate immune responses. PD-L1 is a ligand to PD-1, which is a cell surface receptor expressed on activated T cells in peripheral tissues following antigen exposure.2,3 Both PD-L1 and PD-1 are co-inhibitory molecules involved in blocking T cell-mediated immune responses. PD-L1 also interacts with CD-80, which is a receptor constitutively expressed by T cells and is upregulated early after T cell activation.6
The expression of PD-L1 is an adaptive immune response by tumour cells, resulting in over-expression of the molecule in some cancers.3 PD-L1 interacts with PD-1 and CD80, which leads to blocked cytotoxic T cell activation, T cell proliferation, and cytokine production.7 By binding to PD-L1 and preventing its association with PD-1 and CD80, durvalumab activates the immune responses mediated by cytotoxic T cells that attack tumour cells.7 Durvalumab displays selective and high affinity toward PD-L1 but not PD-L2, which is a regulatory ligand expressed in tumour cells to a lesser extent and involved in regulating inflammation and differentiation of T cells.2

Inflammatory stimuli trigger its production, and it binds to the IL-1 receptor to activate a wide variety of mechanisms. The activity of the IL-1 receptor is also regulated by a naturally occurring IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) that competes for the binding sites of the IL-1 receptor.7 In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, IL-1 levels are elevated, inducing cartilage degradation and the stimulation of bone resorption, and the amount of IL-1Ra in the synovium and synovial fluid of RA patients cannot compete with the high level of IL-1 present.7 Anakinra is a recombinant, non-glycosylated form of IL-1Ra that competes with and inhibits IL-1 by binding to the IL-1 receptor; therefore, the administration of this drug reduces the inflammatory response in RA patients.3,7
Anakinra can also be used in the treatment of neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID) and deficiency of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA).7 Patients with NOMID have spontaneous mutations in CIAS1/NLRP3, a gene that encodes cryopyrin, an inflammasome component. When activated, the inflammasome enhances and promotes the production of IL-1ß, an isoform of IL-1.4,7 DIRA is an autoinflammatory disease caused by mutations in the IL1RN gene. These mutations reduce the amount of IL-1Ra that is secreted, leading to the unopposed action of IL-1.7 Anakinra controls NOMID and DIRA symptoms by inhibiting IL-1 activity.7

In contrast, eletriptan displays insignificant pharmacological activity at adrenergic alpha1, alpha2, or beta; dopaminergic D1 or D2; muscarinic; or opioid receptors. While the full mechanism of action of 5-HT receptor agonists in relieving migrains is not fully elucidated, it is proposed that the activation of 5-HT1 receptors located on intracranial blood vessels leads to vasoconstriction that correlates with the relief of migraine headaches. It is also proposed that the activation of 5-HT1 receptors on sensory nerve endings in the trigeminal system leads to the inhibition of release of pro-inflammatory neuropeptides.

Loss-of-function mutations in ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 have been shown to result in hypolipidemia and a reduced risk of coronary artery disease, while increased levels of these proteins appear to be associated with cardiovascular risk.2,5 While these observations have made ANGPTLs as a class a desirable target in the treatment of hyperlipidemic disorders,2 ANGPTL3 is the first to be pharmacologically targeted for the purposes of lipid-lowering therapy.5 ANGPTL3 is expressed primarily in the liver and acts as an endogenous inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and endothelial lipase (EL) which are responsible, in part, for metabolizing triglycerides (TG) and HDL-C, respectively.7
Evinacumab is monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits ANGPTL3, with the resulting disinhibition of LPL and EL reducing the levels of circulating TG and HDL-C. While the mechanism through which evinacumab reduces LDL-C is not entirely clear, this effect is independent of LDL receptor density and is therefore most likely due to the promotion of VLDL processing and upstream clearance of LDL formation.7

ARBs selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent the protein angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects. As the principal pressor agent of the renin-angiotensin system, Angiotensin II causes vasoconstriction, stimulation of synthesis and release of aldosterone, cardiac stimulation and renal reabsorption of sodium. Olmesartan blocks the vasoconstrictor effects of angiotensin II by selectively blocking the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle. Its action is, therefore, independent of the pathways for angiotensin II synthesis.23 Overall, olmesartan's physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. 
Olmesartan also effects on the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS, which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and preventing ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling.4

As angiotensin II is a vasoconstrictor, which also stimulates the synthesis and release of aldosterone, blockage of its effects results in decreases in systemic vascular resistance. Telmisartan does not inhibit the angiotensin converting enzyme, other hormone receptors, or ion channels. Studies also suggest that telmisartan is a partial agonist of PPAR<U+03B3>, which is an established target for antidiabetic drugs. This suggests that telmisartan can improve carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, as well as control insulin resistance without causing the side effects that are associated with full PPAR<U+03B3> activators.

The gene rearrangement of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a genetic alteration that drives the development of NSCLC in a number of patients 6,7. Ordinarily, ALK is a natural endogenous tyrosine kinase receptor that plays an important role in the development of the brain and elicits activity on various specific neurons in the nervous system 2,5,6.
Subsequnetly, lorlatinib is a kinase inhibitor with in vitro activity against ALK and number of other tyrosine kinase receptor related targets including ROS1, TYK1, FER, FPS, TRKA, TRKB, TRKC, FAK, FAK2, and ACK Label. Lorlatinib demonstrated in vitro activity against multiple mutant forms of the ALK enzyme, including some mutations detected in tumors at the time of disease progression on crizotinib and other ALK inhibitors Label. Moreover, lorlatinib possesses the capability to cross the blood-brain barrier, allowing it to reach and treat progressive or worsening brain metastases as well 10,5. The overall antitumor activity of lorlatinib in in-vivo models appears to be dose-dependent and correlated with the inhibition of ALK phosphorylation Label.
Although many ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC patients respond to initial tyrosine kinase therapies, such patients also often experience tumor progression 8. Various clinical trials performed with lorlatinib, however, have demonstrated its utility to effect tumor regression in ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC patients who experience tumor progression despite current use or having already used various first and second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors like crizotinib, alectinib, or ceritinib 9.

This drug affects central benzodiazepine receptors, which are associated with inhibitory GABA (gamma amino butyric acid)receptors, leading to enhanced GABA binding activity. GABA is a major neurotransmitter in the brain, which causes somnolence, relaxation of muscles, a decrease in anxiety and general central nervous system depression. Nitrazepam has anticonvulsant properties that may be attributed to its ability to bind to voltage-dependent sodium channels. Sustained repetitive firing seems to be limited by benzodiazepines effect of slowing recovery of sodium channels from inactivation.

Yohimbine-mediated norepinephrine release at the level of the corporeal tissues may also be involved. In addition, beneficial effects may involve other neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin and cholinergic receptors.

MAO-B is involved in the oxidative deamination of dopamine in the brain. Selegiline binds to MAO-B within the nigrostriatal pathways in the central nervous system, thus blocking microsomal metabolism of dopamine and enhancing the dopaminergic activity in the substantial nigra. Selegiline may also increase dopaminergic activity through mechanisms other than inhibition of MAO-B. At higher doses, selegiline can also inhibit monozmine oxidase type A (MAO-A), allowing it to be used for the treatment of depression.

Ziprasidone binds to serotonin-2A (5-HT2A) and dopamine D2 receptors in a similar fashion to other atypical antipsychotics; however, one key difference is that ziprasidone has a higher 5-HT2A/D2 receptor affinity ratio when compared to other antipsychotics such as olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, and aripiprazole.1 Ziprasidone offers enhanced modulation of mood, notable negative symptom relief, overall cognitive improvement and reduced motor dysfunction which is linked to it's potent interaction with 5-HT2C, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT1A receptors in brain tissue.1 Ziprasidone can bind moderately to norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake sites which may contribute to its antidepressant and anxiolytic activity.1 Patient's taking ziprasidone will likely experience a lower incidence of orthostatic hypotension, cognitive disturbance, sedation, weight gain, and disruption in prolactin levels since ziprasidone has a lower affinity for histamine H1, muscarinic M1, and alpha1-adrenoceptors.1

In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that statins exert vasculoprotective effects independent of their lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.19 This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.
Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to ß2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.26

Bismuth subsalicylate is an insoluble complex that constitutes salicylic acid and trivalent bismuth. Once orally administered, bismuth subsalicylate hydrolyzes in the stomach into bismuth oxychloride, which is minimally absorbed into the bloodstream, and salicylic acid, which is almost completely absorbed. Bismuth interacts with other anions and compounds, such as hydrochloric acid, bicarbonate, phosphate, and hydrogen sulfide, in the gastrointestinal tract to form bismuth salts such as bismuth oxychloride, bismuth subcarbonate, bismuth phosphate, and bismuth sulfide.2,3 Bismuth salts possess bactericidal and antimicrobial activity, mainly by preventing bacteria from binding and growing on the mucosal cells of the stomach. It has no effects on normal gut flora. By preventing bacteria from binding to mucosal cells, bismuth subsalicylate prevents intestinal secretion and fluid loss, promotes fluid and electrolyte reabsorption, reduces gastrointestinal inflammation, and promotes the healing of pre-existing ulcer in the stomach. Salicylic acid from dissociated bismuth subsalicylate adds to the anti-inflammatory actions of bismuth salts by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase enzyme and limiting the formation of prostaglandin, a pro-inflammatory mediator. Bismuth subsalicylate exhibits cytoprotective and demulcent activity, which makes it an effective drug in peptic ulcer disease. It blocks the adhesion of H. pylori to the gastric epithelial cells and blocks the bacteria's enzyme activities, including phospholipase, protease, and urease.2"	"DB01294"	NA	16682734	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

The conjugate comprises a humanized anti-TROP-2 monoclonal antibody (RS7-3G11, also known as RS7) chemically linked by a hydrolyzable CL2A linker to the cytotoxic drug SN-38.10,4
The proposed mechanism of action first involves the binding of the RS7 component to TROP-2, which is highly expressed on the cell surface of multiple cancers.7 Binding of RS7 to TROP-2 results in rapid internalization of bound antibody2,3, and the likely intracellular release of SN-38 via hydrolysis of the CL2A linker10,8. SN-38 is an active metabolite of the anti-cancer drug irinotecan, which is thought to work primarily through inhibition of DNA topoisomerase I, leading to DNA damage and eventual cell death.5 In addition, recent work has identified a possible secondary mechanism of action for SN-38 by disrupting the binding of Far Upstream Binding Protein 1 (FUBP1) to the FUSE elements regulating oncogene expression.6
In addition to SN-38-mediated cell death, there is also some evidence that the RS7 component of the conjugate drug possesses antibody-directed cellular toxicity.8,4

These lesions are characterized by increased numbers of active melanocytes and increased melanin production Label.
Although the mechanism of action of mequinol is not fully elucidated Label, when employed as an active ingredient in combination with other agents like tretinoin in skin depigmentation products, a synergy between a number of potential mechanisms is proposed.
Firstly, mequinol is in fact considered a melanocytotoxic chemical which when oxidized in melanocytes results in the formation of toxic compounds like quinones 3. Such cytotoxic agents are subsequently capable of damaging and destroying pigment cells, which results in skin depigmentation 3 of solar lentigines or other related hyperpigmented lesions. Nevertheless, skin cells are naturally capable of protecting themselves against such cytotoxic entities by endogenous intracellular glutathione (GSH) 3. This protection is elicited through the enzymatic action of glutathione S-transferase (GST), which is responsible for the conjugation of agents toxic to glutathione 3. Conversely, tretinoin has been observed to serve as a potent inhibitor of mammalian GSTs and to be capable of reducing the level of intracellular GSH in various cells 3. As a result, the combination of mequinol with tretinoin seemingly allows for a synergistic enhancement of a melanocytotoxic effect that involves the inhibition and impairment of GSH and GST cytoprotection 3.
Secondly, even though mequinol is a substrate for the enzyme tyrosinase and therefore acts as a competitive inhibitor of the formation of melanin precursors by way of tyrosinase facilitated reactions, the clinical significance of this action is unknown Label."

Cyanide ion is normally found in serum; it is derived from dietary substrates and from tobacco smoke. Cyanide binds avidly (but reversibly) to ferric ion (Fe+++), most body stores of which are found in erythrocyte methemoglobin (metHgb) and in mitochondrial cytochromes. When CN is infused or generated within the bloodstream, essentially all of it is bound to methemoglobin until intraerythrocytic methemoglobin has been saturated. 
Sodium nitroprusside is further broken down in the circulation to release nitric oxide (NO), which activates guanylate cyclase in the vascular smooth muscle. This leads to increased production of intracellular cGMP, which stimulates calcium ion movement from the cytoplasm to the endoplasmic reticulum, reducing the level of available calcium ions that can bind to calmodulin. This ultimately results in vascular smooth muscle relaxation and vessel dilation.

The M3 subtype is predominantly expressed by smooth muscle cells of the sphincter pupillae, which is a circular muscle of the iris, and ciliary muscles. In response to light or binding of acetylcholine, M3 receptor signalling leads to contraction of the sphincter pupillae and pupil constriction. Contraction of the ciliary muscle via M3 receptor signalling also leads to accommodation, adjusting the lens for near vision.6 The eye is also innervated by parasympathetic nerves: ciliary ganglion neurons project to the ciliary body and the sphincter pupillae muscle of the iris to control ocular accommodation and pupil constriction.7
Tropicamide is a non-selective muscarinic antagonist that binds to all subtypes of muscarinic receptors. By binding to muscarinic receptors, tropicamide relaxes the pupillary sphincter muscle and causes pupil dilation.1 By blocking the muscarinic receptors of the ciliary body, tropicamide also prevents accommodation.6 Like other muscarinic antagonists, tropicamide inhibits the parasympathetic drive, allowing the sympathetic nervous system responses to dominate.1 Tropicamide is thought to ameliorate sialorrhea by blocking M4 receptors expressed on salivary glands and reducing hypersalivation.1

Once FGF binds to the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the receptor, FGFRs dimerize and autophosphorylate the tyrosine residue in the intracellular tyrosine-kinase domain, leading to the activation of the tyrosine kinase.1 Downstream cascades involve phosphorylation of multiple intracellular signalling proteins, such as phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)-AKT and RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phospholipase C<U+03B3>, which activates the protein kinase C pathway.2,1 FGFR-mediated pathway ultimately promotes cell growth, differentiation, survival, angiogenesis, and organogenesis, depending on cell type. Expressed in different isoforms in various tissues and cell lines, FGFRs are not constitutively active in normal cells.1 However, FGFR1, FGFR2, or FGFR3 alterations in certain tumours can lead to constitutive FGFR activation and aberrant FGFR signalling, supporting the proliferation and survival of malignant cells.5
Pemigatinib inhibits FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3, blocking their signalling pathways and decreasing cell viability in cancer cell lines with activating FGFR amplification and fusions that resulted in constitutive activation of FGFR signalling.5 Genetic alterations in FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 (such as amplification, missense, or fusion mutations in the coding region) leading to constitutive activation of FGFR signalling pathways are observed in various tumours.1,4 However, alterations in FGFR genes are demonstrated in selected patients and do not always imply oncogene development. Therefore, it is imperative that fusion or rearrangement of FGFRs are demonstrated through tests prior to initiation of drug therapy.2

PGE2 is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.10 It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.17,10 PGE2 activates the Gq-coupled EP1 receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE2 also activates the EP4 receptor, coupled to Gs, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE2 act via EP3 to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP2 to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP2 receptor which couples to Gs. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI2 is known to play a role via its Gs-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.
PGI2 and PGE2 contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP2 receptors.17,11 Similarly to ß adrenergic receptors these are Gs-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE2 also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.17 PGD2 plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP1 receptor.11 PGI2 and PGE2 modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP2, and EP4 receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.
PGE2 can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory Gq EP3 receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.17 This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE2 thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.

TGMP interferes with the synthesis of guanine nucleotides by its inhibition of purine biosynthesis by pseudofeedback inhibition of glutamine-5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase, the first enzyme unique to the de novo pathway of purine ribonucleotide synthesis. TGMP also inhibits the conversion of inosinic acid (IMP) to xanthylic acid (XMP) by competition for the enzyme IMP dehydrogenase. Thioguanine nucleotides are incorporated into both the DNA and the RNA by phosphodiester linkages, and some studies have shown that incorporation of such false bases contributes to the cytotoxicity of thioguanine. Its tumor inhibitory properties may be due to one or more of its effects on feedback inhibition of de novo purine synthesis; inhibition of purine nucleotide interconversions; or incorporation into the DNA and RNA. The overall result of its action is a sequential blockade of the utilization and synthesis of the purine nucleotides.

Fluorouracil is further metabolized to two active metabolites, 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine 5'-monophosphate (FdUMP) and 5-fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP), within normal and tumour cells. These metabolites cause cell injury by two different mechanisms. First, FdUMP and the folate cofactor, N5-10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, bind to thymidylate synthase (TS) to form a covalently bound ternary complex. This binding inhibits the formation of thymidylate from 2'-deaxyuridylate. Thymidylate is the necessary precursor of thymidine triphosphate, which is essential for the synthesis of DNA, therefore a deficiency of this compound can inhibit cell division. Secondly, nuclear transcriptional enzymes can mistakenly incorporate FUTP in place of uridine triphosphate (UTP) during the synthesis of RNA. This metabolic error can interfere with RNA processing and protein synthesis through the production of fraudulent RNA.

Antiviral activity of efavirenz is dependent on intracellular conversion to the active triphosphorylated form. The rate of efavirenz phosphorylation varies, depending on cell type. It is believed that inhibition of reverse transcriptase interferes with the generation of DNA copies of viral RNA, which, in turn, are necessary for synthesis of new virions. Intracellular enzymes subsequently eliminate the HIV particle that previously had been uncoated, and left unprotected, during entry into the host cell. Thus, reverse transcriptase inhibitors are virustatic and do not eliminate HIV from the body. Even though human DNA polymerase is less susceptible to the pharmacologic effects of triphosphorylated efavirenz, this action may nevertheless account for some of the drug's toxicity.

Pyridostigmine is a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor that increases extracellular acetylcholine levels in the neuromuscular junction by impairing its breakdown by acetylcholinesterase.10,11 The increased acetylcholine leads to increased neural transmission across the junction, which drastically improves myasthenia gravis symptoms.2
In addition to its use in myasthenia gravis and in reversing neuromuscular blocks, pyridostigmine is also a common first-line treatment in congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS), of which there are multiple subtypes caused by mutations in more than 30 distinct genes.3,4 CMS present similarly to myasthenia gravis, albeit due to distinct underlying causes, and often benefit from pyridostigmine. However, in some subgroups, treatment with pyridostigmine is detrimental; detailed genetic testing is required before starting therapy.3,4

Gag encodes proteins involved in the core and the nucleocapsid, while pol encodes the the HIV reverse transcriptase, ribonuclease H, integrase, and protease 1. The pol-encoded proteins are initially translated in the form of a larger precursoe polypeptide, gag-pol, and needs to be cleaved by HIV protease to form other complement proteins 1. Ritonavir prevents the cleavage of the gag-pol polyprotein, which results in noninfectious, immature viral particles. Ritonavir is a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 isoenzyme present both in the intestinal tract and liver 1. It is a type II ligand that perfectly fits into the CYP3A4 active site cavity and irreversibly binds to the heme iron via the thiazole nitrogen, which decreases the redox potential of the protein and precludes its reduction with the redox partner, cytochrome P450 reductase 3. Ritonavir may also play a role in limiting cellular transport and efflux of other protease inhibitors via the P-glycoprotein and MRP efflux channels 1.

There is evidence that it also inhibits the peripheral actions of bradykinin 2. Pizotifen may inhibit serotonin reuptake by blood platelets, which affects the tonicity and decreases passive distension of extracranial arteries 10. The effects of pizotifen leading to appetite stimulation may be due to the drug acting at the metabolic level rather than a direct stimulation of the appetite centre 3.

The If currents are located in the sinoatrial node and are the home of all cardiac pacemaker activity. Ivabradine therefore lowers the pacemaker firing rate, consequently lowering heart rate and reducing myocardial oxygen demand. This allows for an improved oxygen supply and therefore mitigation of ischemia, allowing for a higher exercise capacity and reduction in angina episodes.

On one hand, the majority of official prescribing information labels, monographs, and prior research studies for ulipristal indicated as an emergency contraceptive suggest that its primary mechanism of action revolves around inhibiting or delaying ovulation by suppressing surges in LH that result in the postponement of follicular rupture 9,13,16.
Conversely, some of the latest investigations pertaining to ulipristal's mechanism of action as an emergency contraceptive propose that it principally elicits its action by preventing embryo implantation, as opposed to preventing ovulation 10,11,12. Although previous investigations have shown that ulipristal essentially has the ability to prevent ovulation equivalent to placebo (ie. null effect or ability) when administered during LH peaks one to two days before ovulation, the agent still demonstrates a stable and consistently high contraceptive effect of approximately >=80% when used at this time 10. Subsequently, current studies attempt to investigate how ulipristal could elicit emergency contraception via ovulation prevention under circumstances where ovulation had already clearly been observed 10,11,12. Endometrial biopsy samples studied from such circumstances in such investigations subsequently show that the administered ulipristal causes endometrial tissue to become inhospitable and unsuitable for embryo implantation where a variety of genes characteristic of receptive, pro-gestational endometrium are downregulated 10,11,12. 
Nevertheless, most if not all proposed mechanisms commonly agree that ulipristal ultimately demonstrates its pharmacological effects by binding to human progesterone receptors and prevents natural, endogenous progesterone from occupying such receptors 9,13,16,10,11,12. Regardless, however, considering current and on-going research into ulipristal's ability to prevent embryo implantation, the notion that the medication can elicit post-fertilization effects potentially raises alerts and/or ethical debates over the use of ulipristal owing to potential abortifacient activity 9,10,11,12, which is considered to be on par or equipotent to that of mifepristone 15. Attention should be drawn to the fact that some prescribing information, however, such as the US FDA label for ulipristal indicated for emergency contraception, has included new supplementary commentary since 2018 that directly warns about ulipristal not being indicated for termination of existing pregnancies and suggesting that ulipristal use may confer alterations to the endometrium that may affect implantation and contribute to efficacy Label. 
In the treatment of fibroids, ulipristal has been shown to exert direct actions on fibroids reducing their size through inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis.

The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signalling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism. Insulin glargine is completely soluble at pH 4, the pH of administered solution, and has low solubility at physiological pH 7.4. Upon subcuteous injection, the solution is neutralized resulting in the formation of microprecipitates. Small amounts of insulin glargine are released from microprecipitates giving the drug a relatively constant concentration over time profile over 24 hours with no pronounced peak. This release mechanism allows the drug to mimic basal insulin levels within the body.

Most drug therapies aim to alleviate symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia, silodosin included. Lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia are categorized into three main groups: voiding or obstructive (hesitancy, slow stream, intermittency, incomplete emptying), storage or irritative (frequency, urgency, nocturia, urge urinary incontinence), and postmicturition (postvoid dribbling). Prostate contraction is the main contributor to lower urinary tract symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The smooth muscle tone of the prostate is regulated by a1A-adrenoceptors, which are the most highly expressed subtype of a1adrenoceptors in the human prostate tissue.2 It has been reported that blockade of a1A-adrenoceptors relieves bladder outlet obstruction. Blockade of a1D-adrenoceptors, another subtype found in prostate tissue, is believed to alleviate storage symptoms due to detrusor overactivity.6
a1-adrenoceptors are G protein-coupled receptors: upon binding of its natural ligand, norepinephrine and epinephrine, leads to the activation of phospholipase C and downstream signalling molecules, including inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol. Ultimately, there is an increase in intracellular calcium levels and, consequently, smooth muscle contraction. Silodosin is an antagonist of a1-adrenoceptors, with the highest selectivity for the a1A-adrenoceptor subtype. By blocking the a1A-adrenoceptor signalling pathway, silodosin promotes prostatic and urethral smooth muscle relaxation, thereby improving lower urinary tract symptoms such as voiding. Silodosin also targets afferent nerves in the bladder, relieving bladder overactivity and storage symptoms.2

Variants of the gene encoding IL-23 p19 subunit and the IL-23 receptor have been recognized as part of the pathogenesis of plaque psoriasis, rendering IL-23 an ideal target for risankizumab therapy.2

When GABA binds to GABA(a) receptors found in neuron synapses, chloride ions are conducted across neuron cell membranes via an ion channel in the receptors 6,7,8,13. With enough chloride ions conducted, the local, associated neuron membrane potentials are hyperpolarized - making it more difficult or less likely for action potentials to fire, ultimately resulting in less excitation of the neurons 6,7,8,13. 
Subsequently, benzodiazepines like clonazepam can bind to benzodiazepine receptors that are components of various varieties of GABA(a) receptors 6,7,8,13,11,12. This binding acts to enhance the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA(a) receptor, which ultimately enhances GABA ligand binding at the receptors 6,7,8,13,11,12. This enhanced ligand binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the receptors increases the aforementioned chloride ion conduction (perhaps reportedly via an increase in the frequency of the chloride channel opening), resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the associated neuron cells 6,7,8,13,11,12. Combined with the notion that such benzodiazepine receptor associated GABA(a) receptors exist both peripherally and in the CNS, this activity consequently facilitates various effects like sedation, hypnosis, skeletal muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, and anxiolytic action 6,7,8,13,11,12.
In particular, when out of the ordinary rapid and repetitive electrical signals are released in the CNS, it is proposed that the brain can become over-stimulated and ordinary functions are disrupted - resulting in seizure activity 8. By enhancing the neuro-inhibitory activity of GABA, it is believed that clonazepam can facilitate in decreasing any excessive electrical nerve activity in the CNS that might be contributing to seizures 8. Concurrently, it is also believed that clonazepam's actions in enhancing GABA effects may inhibit neuronal activity proposed to occur in amygdala-centered fear circuits - therefore assisting in the management of anxiety or panic 7.

Upon ligand binding and subsequent dimerization of cytokine and hormone receptors, receptor-associated JAKs are activated and phosphorylated. This allows the binding of Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs), which are transcription factors. STAT binds to the receptor, and JAK phosphorylates and activates STAT to create a STAT dimer. The STAT dimer translocates to the nucleus to upregulate the gene transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors implicated in atopic dermatitis.3,2 Blocking the JAK-STAT pathway is advantageous, as it is an intracellular signalling pathway where many pro-inflammatory pathways converge.4
Each JAK plays a role in the signalling and regulation of different cytokines and immune cells. In atopic dermatitis, JAK1 is the therapeutic target of focus as it is involved in the signalling of the <U+03B3>c family of cytokines involved in immune responses and disease pathophysiology, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, and IL-15.2 Abrocitinib reversibly inhibits JAK1 by blocking the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site. Biochemical assays demonstrate that abrocitinib is selective for JAK1 over JAK2 (28-fold), JAK3 (>340-fold), and tyrosine kinase (TYK) 2 (43-fold), as well as the broader kinome.5 Similarly, in cellular settings, abrocitinib preferentially inhibited cytokine-induced STAT phosphorylation by signalling pairs involving JAK1, while sparing signalling by JAK2/JAK2, or JAK2/TYK2 pairs.6 The relevance of inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to the drug's therapeutic effectiveness is currently unknown.5

S1P1R, S1P2R, and S1P3R receptors can be found in the cardiovascular, immune, and central nervous systems. S1P4R is found on lymphocytic and hematopoietic cells, while S1P5R expression is found only on the spleen (on natural killer cells) or in the central nervous system.6
The active form of the drug, fingolimod phosphate, is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator that exerts its mechanism of action in MS by binding to various sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors (1, 3, 4, and 5). It suppresses the exit of lymphocytes from lymph nodes, leading to a lower level of lymphocytes circulating in peripheral circulation. This reduces the inflammation that is associated with MS. The mechanism of action of fingolimod is not fully understood, but may be related to reduced lymphocyte circulation into the central nervous system.3,12
Immune modulating treatment such as fingolimod is not typically employed for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Despite this, with the tissue findings of pulmonary edema and hyaline membrane formation, the timely use of immune modulators such as fingolimod can be considered to prevent acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) associated with COVID-19. 13

They also play a role in the formation of the mitotic spindle and chromosomal segregation to the daughter cells at mitosis 4. Via GTP hydrolysis at the ß-tubulin subunit and polymerization of tubulin into linear polymers, microtubules, or macromolecular filaments composed of tubulin heterodimers, are formed via a mechanism of nucleation-elongation 4. At the onset of mitosis, the interphase microtubule network disassembles into the tubulin. The tubulin reassembles into a new population of mitotic spindle microtubules that further undergo rapid successions of lengthening and shortening until they are attached to the newly duplicated sister chromatids at their centromeres 4. The dynamic behaviour of microtubules are characterized by two mechanical process: dynamic instability indicating repeated switches of growth and shortening at the ends, and microtubule treadmilling that involves the fast-growing (+) end of the microtubule accompanied by a net loss of the opposite slow-growing (-) end 4. Microtubule treadmilling plays a critical role in mitosis by generating the forces for separation of the chromosomes in the mitotic spindle from centrosome and kinetochores. 
In both cancer and normal cells, vinflunine binds to tubulin at or near to the vinca binding sites at ß-tubulin. It is proposed that in similarity to other vinca alkaloids, vinflunine is most likely to bind to ß-tubulin subunit at the interdimer interface 4. Via direct binding to tubulin, vinflunine inhibits microtubule polymerization and induces a G2+M arrest, or a mitotic arrest 3. Vinflunine disrupts the dynamic function of microtubules by suppressing treadmilling and slowing the microtubule growth rate while increasing growth duration 2. Ultimately, mitotic accumulation at the metaphase/anaphase transition results in cell apoptosis 3.

NPC1L1 is expressed on enterocytes/gut lumen (apical) as well as the hepatobiliary (canalicular) interface and plays a role in facilitating internalization of free cholesterol into the enterocyte in conjunction with the adaptor protein 2 (AP2) complex and clathrin.2 Once cholesterol in the gut lumen or bile is incorporated into the cell membrane of enterocytes, it binds to the sterol-sensing domain of NPC1L1 and forms a NPC1L1/cholesterol complex. The complex is then internalized or endocytosed by joining to AP2 clathrin, forming a vesicle complex that is translocated for storage in the endocytic recycling compartment.2
Ezetimibe does not require exocrine pancreatic function for its pharmacological activity; rather, it localizes and appears to act at the brush border of the small intestine. Ezetimibe selectively blocks the NPC1L1 protein in the jejunal brush border, reducing the uptake of intestinal lumen micelles into the enterocyte.2 Overall, ezetimibe causes a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver and reduction of hepatic cholesterol stores and an increase in clearance of cholesterol from the blood. While the full mechanism of action of ezetimibe in reducing the entry of cholesterol into both enterocytes and hepatocytes is not fully understood, one study proposed that ezetimibe prevents the NPC1L1/sterol complex from interacting with AP2 in clathrin coated vesicles and induces a conformational change in NPC1L1, rendering it incapable of binding to sterols.2 Another study suggested that ezetimibe disrupts the function of other protein complexes involved in regulating cholesterol uptake, including the CAV1–annexin 2 heterocomplex.2

Inclisiran is conjugated to triantennary N-acetylgalactosamine carbohydrates, which can bind to asialoglycoprotein receptors expressed in the liver. Binding to asialoglycoprotein receptors facilitates the uptake of inclisiran into the hepatocytes. Once inside the hepatocyte, inclisiran binds to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which is a ribonucleoprotein complex that serves as a template for recognizing the target complementary mRNA, activate RNAse, and cleave the target mRNA.5 Inclisiran incorporated into the RISC allows the drug to cleave PCSK9 mRNA and prevent PCSK9 translation, thus decreasing hepatic production of PCSK9.1 Less PCSK9 protein available allows more LDL receptors to be recycled to the hepatic membrane for circulating LDL-C uptake.7

The overexpression of ALAS1, in combination with downstream enzyme deficiencies, leads to the overproduction and accumulation of toxic heme intermediates which are ultimately responsible for the neurovisceral symptoms characteristic of acute hepatic porphyrias.5,2
Givosiran is a double-stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed at ALAS1 mRNA in hepatocytes.5 It is covalently bound to a ligand containing three N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues that facilitate uptake into hepatocytes via asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASPGRs), which are highly expressed on the cell surface of hepatocytes and are selective for glycoproteins containing GalNAc residues.7 Following endocytosis into hepatocytes, the antisense strand of givosiran is loaded into an enzyme complex called the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which uses the antisense strand to seek out and selectively cleave the complementary mRNA sequence (in this case found between nucleotide 918 and 937 of the ALAS1 mRNA).7 Cleavage of the ALAS1 mRNA results in its degradation, preventing the synthesis of the ALAS1 enzyme and ultimately leading to reduced circulating levels of neurotoxic heme intermediates.

It serves as the hormonal mediator for the hyperplasia upon accumulation within the prostate gland.8 DHT displays a higher affinity towards androgen receptors in the prostate gland compared to testosterone13 and by acting on the androgen receptors, DHT modulates genes that are responsible for cell proliferation.9 Responsible for the synthesis of approximately one-third of circulating DHT, type I 5a-reductase is predominant in the sebaceous glands of most regions of skin, including the scalp, and liver. The type II 5a-reductase isozyme is primarily found in the prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymides, and hair follicles as well as liver, and is responsible for two-thirds of circulating DHT.15 Due to its dual inhibition of both isoenzymes of 5a-reductase, dutasteride causes a near-complete suppression of DHT.6 Compared to a 70% reduction of serum DHT levels caused by finasteride, a near-complete suppression of serum DHT-more than 90% is seen with dutasteride.12
By forming a stable complex with both type II and type II 5a-reductase, dutasteride inhibits its enzymatic action of converting testosterone to 5a-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which is the androgen primarily responsible for the initial development and subsequent enlargement of the prostate gland. It is proposed that DHT is the principal androgen responsible for prostatic growth in later life-normal masculinization of the external genitalia and maturation of the prostate gland during development-thus reducing the serum DHT levels results in reduced prostatic volume and increased epithelial apoptosis.11 Dutasteride is a competitive and specific inhibitor of both Type I and Type II 5a-reductase isoenzymes and when evaluated under in vitro and in vivo conditions, the dissociation of the drug from the drug-enzyme complex is reported to be extremely slow.15 Dutasteride does not bind to the human androgen receptor.15

These downstream cascades promote the expression of genes involved in B cell proliferation and survival.2 The BCR signalling pathway also induces the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL and regulates the integrin a4ß1 (VLA-4)-mediated adhesion of B cells to vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and fibronectin via BTK. Apart from the direct downstream signal transduction pathway of B cells, BTK is also involved in chemokine receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR) and Fc receptor signalling pathways.6
Zanubrutinib inhibits BTK by forming a covalent bond with cysteine 481 residue in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)–binding pocket of BTK, which is the enzyme's active site. This binding specificity is commonly seen with other BTK inhibitors. Due to this binding profile, zanubrutinib may also bind with varying affinities to related and unrelated ATP-binding kinases that possess a cysteine residue at this position.4 By blocking the BCR signalling pathway, zanubrutinib inhibits the proliferation, trafficking, chemotaxis, and adhesion of malignant B cells, ultimately leading to reduced tumour size.7 Zanubrutinib was also shown to downregulate programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1) expression and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) on CD4+ T cells.1

During sexual arousal, non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) neurons release nitric oxide (NO). Nitric oxide stimulates guanylate cyclase which converts guanosine triphosphate to cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP).2,3 cGMP activates the cGMP-dependent kinase (PKG) in a signal cascade which activates K+ channels leading to inhibition of Ca2+ channels, inhibits platelet activation, and inhibits smooth muscle cell proliferation while inducing apoptosis. This signal cascade is attenuated by PDE5 which breaks the phosphodiester bond of cGMP, converting it to GMP. Inhibition of PDE5 by tadalafil increases signaling via the PKG cascade which supports penile smooth muscle relaxation during sexual arousal by decreasing Ca2+ entry into smooth muscle cells. This smooth muscle relaxation allows blood to fill the corpus cavernosum thereby producing an erection.
In PAH, blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries is raised due to a variety of mechanisms stemming from endothelial dysfunction.3 Decreased production of NO and prostacyclin reduce vasodilatory signaling while overproduction of endothelin-1 and thromboxane increase vasoconstriction. Inflammation, thromboses, and hypoxia later contribute to vascular remodeling which further reduces luminal size. The resultant increase in blood pressure reduces the capacity for gas exchange and increases afterload at the right ventricle, producing symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and dizziness as well as leading to right-sided heart failure. Tadalafil exerts its therapeutic effect in PAH through boosting NO-cGMP signaling to contribute to smooth muscle relaxation as with ED.
Lastly, tadalafil is used to treat BPH.7 BPH produces urinary dysfunction through hyperproliferation of the epithelial and smooth muscle layers of the prostate.4 The increased size of the prostate blocks urine flow through the urethra resulting in higher residual volumes due to incomplete emptying. Tadalafil does not appear to exert its benefit via smooth muscle relaxation of the prostate. It may instead exert its effect through a mix of increased oxygenation and decreased inflammation, which decreases tissue remodeling, and inhibition of cell proliferation through the cGMP cascade.
The decreased affinity for PDE6 compared to other PDE5 inhibitors may explain the decreased incidence of visual side effects as PDE6 is present in the eye and contributes to color vision.8,9,2

Danazol also depresses the preovulatory surge in output of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), thereby reducing ovarian estrogen production. Danazol may also directly inhibits ovarian steroidogenesis; bind to androgen, progesterone, and glucocorticoid receptors; bind to sex-hormone-binding globulin and corticosteroid-binding globulin; and increases the metabolic clearance rate of progesterone. Another mechanism of action by which danazol may use to facilitate regression of endometriosis is by decreasing IgG, IgM, and IgA concentrations, as well as phospholipid and IgG isotope autoantibodies. In the treatment of endometriosis, as a consequence of suppression of ovarian function, danazol causes both normal and ectopic endometrial tissues to become inactive and atrophic. This leads to anovulation and associated amenorrhea. In fibrocystic breast disease, the exact mechanism of action of danazol is unknown, but may be related to suppressed estrogenic stimulation as a result of decreased ovarian production of estrogen. A direct effect on steroid receptor sites in breast tissue is also possible. This leads to a disappearance of nodularity, relief of pain and tenderness, and possibly changes in the menstrual pattern. In terms of hereditary angioedema, danazol corrects the underlying biochemical deficiency by increasing serum concentrations of the deficient C1 esterase inhibitor, resulting in increased serum concentrations of the C4 component of the complement system.

Animal and human studies show that Aprepitant augments the antiemetic activity of the 5-HT3-receptor antagonist ondansetron and the corticosteroid
ethasone and inhibits both the acute and delayed phases of cisplatin induced emesis.
In summary, the active form of fosaprepitant is as an NK1 antagonist which is because it blocks signals given off by NK1 receptors. This therefore decreases the likelihood of vomiting in patients experiencing."	"DB06717"	NA	135413538	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

It normally cleaves the protein angiotensinogen to form angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is then converted to angiotensin II, an active protein. Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor that causes the release of catecholamines into the circulation. It also promotes the secretion of aldosterone in addition to sodium reabsorption, increasing blood pressure. Additionally, angiotensin II acts on the adrenal cortex where it stimulates aldosterone release. Aldosterone increases sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion in the nephron. 11
Aliskiren prevents the above process via binding to renin at its active site, stopping the cleavage of angiotensin, in turn inhibiting the formation of angiotensin I. This ends the cascade of angiotensin II mediated mechanisms that normally increase blood pressure.5

Two mechanisms are suggested in regards to the potency of tipranavir: 1. Tipravanir may bind to the active site of the protease enzyme with fewer hydrogen bonds than peptidic protease inhibitors, which results in increased flexibility, allowing it to fit into the active site of the enzyme in viruses that have become resistance to other protease inhibitors. This also enables tipranavir to adjust to amino acid substitutions at the active site. 2. Tipranavir's strong hydrogen bonding interaction with the amide backbone of the protease active site Asp30 may lead to its activity against resistant viruses.

Bortezomib is a reversible inhibitor of the 26S proteasome, which is made up of a 20S core complexed with a 19S regulatory complex. Individual ß-subunits allow specific catalytic action of the 20S core.3,4 In mammalian cells, bortezomib is a potent inhibitor of the proteasome’s chymotryptic-like activity, which is attributed to the ß5-subunit of the 20S core particle.3 Bortezomib binds to the active site of the threonine hydroxyl group in the ß5-subunit.4 A probing study showed bortezomib also binding to and inhibiting the ß1-subunit, which mediates the caspase-like activity of the proteasome, and ß1i-subunit, which is an altered subunit that is expressed to form immunoproteasomes in response to cell stress or inflammation.3 By inhibiting the proteasome-mediated degradation of key proteins that promote cell apoptosis,2 bortezomib induces a cell cycle arrest during the G2-M phase.10 It is believed that multiple mechanisms, other than proteasome inhibition, may be involved in the anticancer activity of bortezomib.4 The anticancer activity of bortezomib was largely associated with suppression of the NF-<U+03BA>B signalling pathway, resulting in the downregulation of anti-apoptotic target genes and expression of anti-apoptic proteins. This may be explained by bortezomib preventing uncontrolled degradation of I<U+03BA>B, which is an inhibitory protein of NF-<U+03BA>B. NOXA, which is a pro-apoptotic factor, induced by bortezomib selectively in cancer cells; thus, it is suggested to be another key mechanism of bortezomib.4

Over-expressed in breast tumour cells, HER-2 overamplifies the signal provided by other receptors of the HER family by forming heterodimers 4. The HER-2 receptor is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that consists of an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a transmembrane region, and an intracellular or cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. It is activated by the formation of homodimers or heterodimers with other EGFR proteins, leading to dimerization and autophosphorylation and/or transphosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in EGFR intracellular domains 4. Further downstream molecular signaling cascades are activated, such as the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt, and the phospholipase C<U+03B3> (PLC<U+03B3>)/protein kinase C (PKC) pathways that promote cell growth and survival and cell cycle progression 4. Due to upregulation of HER-2 in tumour cells, hyperactivation of these signaling pathways and abnormal cell proliferation is observed. Trastuzumab binds to the extracellular ligand-binding domain and blocks the cleavage of the extracellular domain of HER-2 to induce its antibody-induced receptor downmodulation 4, and subsequently inhibits HER-2-mediated intracellular signaling cascades. Inhibition of MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways lead to an increase in cell cycle arrest, and the suppression of cell growth and proliferation 4. Trastuzumab also mediates the activation of antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) 6 by attracting the immune cells, such as natural killer (NK) cells, to tumor sites that overexpress HER-2 4. While the drug alone has a minimal potential to induce complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC),8 one study demonstrated increased therapeutic effectiveness and a synergistic effect on uterine serous carcinoma cells in vitro when used in combination with pertuzumab, which also has minor effects on CDC alone. This study showed that only the combination of both cell-bound antibodies would be sufficient to bind and activate the complement component 1q (C1q) required to initiate the complement cascade reaction.9
Intrinsic trastuzumab resistance has been noted for some patients with HER-2 positive breast cancer. Mechanisms involving trastuzumab resistance include deficiency of phosphatase and tensin homologue and activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and the overexpression of other surface receptors, such as insulin-like growth factor 6.

Replication of the viral genome is a key step in the infectious cycle of RNA viruses, including those of the Filoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Pneumoviridae, and Coronaviridae families, and is carried out by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) enzymes or enzyme complexes.9,10 For both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the RdRp comprises nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 subunits under physiological conditions, although functional RdRp complexes can be reassembled in vitro that incorporate only the nsp8 and nsp12 subunits, similar to the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).10
Remdesivir is a phosphoramidite prodrug of a 1'-cyano-substituted adenosine nucleotide analogue that competes with ATP for incorporation into newly synthesized viral RNA by the corresponding RdRp complex.10 Remdesivir enters cells before being cleaved to its monophosphate form through the action of either carboxylesterase 1 or cathepsin A; it is subsequently phosphorylated by undescribed kinases to yield its active triphosphate form remdesivir triphosphate (RDV-TP or GS-443902).9,18 RDV-TP is efficiently incorporated by the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp complex, with a 3.65-fold selectivity for RDV-TP over endogenous ATP.10,18 Unlike some nucleoside analogues, remdesivir provides a free 3'-hydroxyl group that allows for continued chain elongation.10,18 However, modelling and in vitro experiments suggest that at i + 4 (corresponding to the position for the incorporation of the fourth nucleotide following RDV-TP incorporation), the 1'-cyano group of remdesivir sterically clashes with Ser-861 of the RdRp, preventing further enzyme translocation and terminating replication at position i + 3. This mechanism was essentially identical between SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV, and genomic comparisons reveal that Ser-861 is conserved across alpha-, beta-, and deltacoronaviruses, suggesting remdesivir may possess broad antiviral activity.10
Considerations for the use of nucleotide analogues like remdesivir include the possible accumulation of resistance mutations. Excision of analogues through the 3'-5' exonuclease (ExoN) activity of replication complexes, mediated in SARS-CoV by the nsp14 subunit, is of possible concern.10 Murine hepatitis viruses (MHVs) engineered to lack ExoN activity are approximately 4-fold more susceptible to remdesivir, supporting the proposed mechanism of action.3 However, the relatively mild benefit of ExoN activity to remdesivir resistance is proposed to involve its delayed chain termination mechanism, whereby additional endogenous nucleotides are incorporated following RDV-TP.10 In addition, serial passage of MHV in increasing concentrations of the remdesivir parent molecule GS-441524 led to the development of resistance mutations F476L and V553L, which maintain activity when transferred to SARS-CoV. However, these mutant viruses are less fit than wild-type in both competition assays and in vivo in the absence of selective pressure.3 To date, no clinical data on SARS-CoV-2 resistance to remdesivir have been described.18

Emerging evidence suggests that many cells and tissues are selectively vulnerable to reduced SMN concentrations, making this protein a desirable target in the treatment of SMA.1
Risdiplam is an mRNA splicing modifier for SMN2 that increases the inclusion of exon 7 during splicing, which ultimately increases the amount of functional SMN protein produced by SMN2.3 It does so by binding to two sites in SMN2 pre-mRNA: the 5' splice site (5'ss) of intron 7 and the exonic splicing enhancer 2 (ESE2) of exon 7.4"	"DB15305"	NA	118513932	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

Activation of beta2-adrenergic receptors on airway smooth muscle leads to the activation of adenyl cyclase and to an increase in the intracellular concentration of cyclic-3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP).Label,3,4 This increase of cyclic AMP leads to the activation of protein kinase A, which inhibits the phosphorylation of myosin and lowers intracellular ionic calcium concentrations, resulting in relaxation.Label,3,4 Salbutamol relaxes the smooth muscles of all airways, from the trachea to the terminal bronchioles.Label,3,4 Salbutamol acts as a functional antagonist to relax the airway irrespective of the spasmogen involved, thus protecting against all bronchoconstrictor challenges.Label,3,4 Increased cyclic AMP concentrations are also associated with the inhibition of release of mediators from mast cells in the airway.Label,3,4
Salbutamol has been shown in most controlled clinical trials to have more effect on the respiratory tract, in the form of bronchial smooth muscle relaxation, than isoproterenol at comparable doses while producing fewer cardiovascular effects.Label,3,4 Controlled clinical studies and other clinical experience have shown that inhaled albuterol, like other beta-adrenergic agonist drugs, can produce a significant cardiovascular effect in some patients, as measured by pulse rate, blood pressure, symptoms, and/or electrocardiographic changes.Label,3,4
A measurable decrease in airway resistance is typically observed within 5 to 15 minutes after inhalation of salbutamol.Label,3,4 The maximum improvement in pulmonary function usually occurs 60 to 90 minutes after salbutamol treatment, and significant bronchodilator activity has been observed to persist for 3 to 6 hours.Label,3,4

The nitroreductase enzyme which activates pretomanid is deazaflavin dependent and relies on reduced cofactor F420. Reduction of F420 occurs via the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.10 Reduction of pretomanid's imidazole ring at the C-3 position causes the formation of the metabolites, which include a des-nitro derivative. The formation of this derivative leads to increased levels of nitric oxide, leading to bactericidal activities under anaerobic conditions via its action as a bacterial respiratory poison.3,10 Bactericidal activity against anaerobes is reported to be associated with a shortened duration of antibiotic treatment.4
Pretomanid exerts aerobic bactericidal effects through its inhibitory actions on bacterial cell wall mycolic acid biosynthesis. This allows for the killing of actively replicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria, resulting in the treatment of active tuberculosis infection.4,10 The molecular mechanism of the above bactericidal effects is poorly understood at this time, but may involve effects exerted on various genes that affect the cell wall, including the fasI and fasII as well as the efpA and iniBAC operons. Other possible targets include the genes of the cyd operon. The clinical effects of the above target relations are unknown at this time.5

The anti-CD3 effector domain of tebentafusp engages and activates CD3+ T cells to inflammatory cytokines and cytolytic proteins, which results in direct lysis of uveal melanoma tumour cells.4 The anti-CD3 fragment of the drug has a lower affinity, so the T cells are not stimulated unless tebentafusp has detected gp100.2 As the HLA-A02:01 subtype is not present in all individuals,2 tebentafusp is only effective in HLA-A02:01-positive patients.4

Lenalidomide exerts immunomodulating effects by altering cytokine production, regulating T cell co-stimulation, and enhancing the NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity.3 Lenalidomide directly inhibits the cullin ring E3 ubiquitin ligase complex: upon binding to cereblon, a substrate adaptor of the complex, lenalidomide modulates substrate specificity of the complex to recruit substrate proteins of the ligase, including Ikaros (IKZF1), Aiolos (IKZF3), and CK1a.9 These substrates are then tagged for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. IKZF1 and IKZF3 are B-cell transcription factors that are essential for B-cell differentiation and survival of malignant cells. IKZF3 also regulates the expression of interferon regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), which is a transcription factor that regulates the aberrant myeloma-specific gene. The immunomodulatory actions of lenalidomide can be partly explained by the degradation of IKZF3, since it is a repressor of the interleukin 2 gene (IL2): as lenalidomide decreases the level of IKZF3, the production of IL-2 increases, thereby increasing the proliferation of natural killer (NK), NKT cells, and CD4+ T cells.6 Lenalidomide inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-12, while elevating the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10.3 Lenalidomide acts as a T-cell co-stimulatory molecule that promotes CD3 T-cell proliferation and increases the production of IL-2 and IFN-<U+03B3> in T lymphocytes, which enhances NK cell cytotoxicity and ADCC. It inhibits the expression and function of T-regulatory cells, which are often overabundant in some hematological malignancies.7
Lenalidomide directly exerts antitumour effects by inhibiting the proliferation and inducing apoptosis of tumour cells. Lenalidomide triggers the activation of pro-apoptotic caspase-8, enhances tumour cell sensitivity to FAS-induced apoptosis, and downregulates NF-<U+03BA>B, an anti-apoptotic protein.7 Independent of its immunomodulatory effects, lenalidomide mediates anti-angiogenic effects by inhibiting angiogenic growth factors released by tumour cells, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblastic-growth factor (BFGF), and hepatocyte-growth factor. In vitro, lenalidomide inhibits cell adhesion molecules such as ICAM-1, LFA-1, ß2 and ß3 integrins, as well as gap-junction function, thereby preventing metastasis of malignant cells.7

Two types of alpha receptors, alpha 1 and alpha 2, both play a role in regulating blood pressure. Alpha-1 receptors are postsynaptic (located after the nerve junction, or space between a nerve fiber and target tissue). In this case, the target tissue is the vascular smooth muscle 18. These receptors, when activated, increase blood pressure 9. 
Prazosin inhibits the postsynaptic alpha-1 adrenoceptors. This inhibition blocks the vasoconstricting (narrowing) effect of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) on the vessels, leading to peripheral blood vessel dilation. Through blood vessel constriction by adrenergic receptor activation, epinephrine and norepinephrine normally act to increase blood pressure 10.

SMN protein is found ubiquitously but it is highly expressed in the spinal cord where it is responsible for the survival and maintenance of specialized nerve cells called motor neurons.6 SMN1 and SMN2 genes encode the SMN protein but many mutations in the SMN1 gene have been found to cause spinal muscular atrophy,3,6 as SMN1 is the primary gene responsible for functional production of SMN protein.1 A common mutation that causes spinal muscular atrophy involves a bi-allelic deletion of exon 7 in the SMN1 gene.3 The number of copies of the SMN2 gene varies among individuals: while higher number of SMN2 gene copies may protect against SMN protein deficiency caused by SMN1 gene mutations,6 it is generally proposed that the bi-allelic mutation in the SMN1 gene cannot be compensated by the SMN2 gene.3 The mutation results in insufficient SMN protein expression and inefficient assembly of the machinery needed to process pre-mRNA for motor neuron development and survival. Spinal muscular atrophy involves a progressive degeneration and loss of lower motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness and atrophy.1,5

The HIV-1 protease enzyme, a dimeric aspartic protease, is the enzyme responsible for cleaving the Gag polyprotein and thus plays a critical role in many aspects of the HIV viral lifecycle.2
Lopinavir is an inhibitor of the HIV-1 protease enzyme.7 Its design is based on the \peptidomimetic\ principle, wherein the molecule contains a hydroxyethylene scaffold which mimics the normal peptide linkage (cleaved by HIV protease) but which itself cannot be cleaved.5 By preventing HIV-1 protease activity, and thus the proteolysis of the Gag polyprotein, lopinavir results in the production of immature, non-infectious viral particles.

Under normal conditions, the 12-exon LMNA gene produces full-length prelamin A, which undergoes farnesylation of the C-terminal CaaX motif, followed by proteolytic cleavage of the terminal three amino acids (aaX) by the metalloproteinase ZMPSTE24, subsequent carboxymethylation, and finally removal of the last 15 amino acids to yield mature, unfarnesylated, lamin A protein.1,4 In HGPS, a single heterozygous C-to-T mutation at position 1824 results in a cryptic splice site that removes the last 150 nucleotides of exon 11 and a concomitant 50-amino acid deletion in the C-terminus of the prelamin A protein. This aberrant prelamin A protein, often called progerin, is permanently farnesylated but unable to complete maturation due to the removal of the second endoproteolytic cleavage site.1,4
Although the exact mechanism is unclear, progerin accumulation results in a host of adverse symptoms associated with ageing such as skeletal dysplasia, joint contractures, atherosclerosis, myocardial fibrosis/dysfunction, scleroderma-like cutaneous effects, lipoatrophy, alopecia, and a severe failure to thrive.1,2,3,4,5 An additional notable effect of HGPS is increased vascular and peripheral calcification.6 Children affected by HGPS typically die due to myocardial infarction or stroke.5 Mechanistic understanding of HGPS remains unclear, although a recent study correlated progerin accumulation, telomere dysfunction, DNA damage-mediated inflammatory cytokine release, and HGPS symptoms, suggesting that the nuclear effects of progerin accumulation may result in pleiotropic downstream effects.7
Lonafarnib is a farnesyl transferase (FTase) inhibitor (FTI), with a reported IC50 value of 1.9 nM; lonafarnib is specific for FTase, as it does not appreciably inhibit the related GGPT-1 enzyme at concentrations up to 50 µM.8 Inhibition of progerin farnesylation reduces progerin accumulation in the inner nuclear membrane, which subsequently slows the progression of HGPS and other progeroid laminopathies.1,9,10,13

Somatotropin mediates its effects both directly by somatotropin and indirectly by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which is upregulated by growth hormone. It binds to the human growth hormone receptor (GHR), which is a dimeric receptor expressed in target cells in the liver and cartilage.5 Upon binding of growth hormone, GHR dimerizes and interacts with Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), subsequently leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and the GH receptor. The signal transducer activator of transcription (STAT) pathway is initiated, where transcription factors such as STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5 are translocated into the nucleus to stimulate target gene transcription.6
At the epiphysis or growth plate, growth hormone increases linear growth by promoting differentiation of prechondrocytes and expansion of osteoblasts. Growth hormone binding to its receptor in the liver and cartilage promotes the production of IGF-1, which acts on type 1 IGF receptors to also stimulate linear growth. In the liver, activated growth hormone receptor signalling leads to increased production of IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) and acid-labile subunit (ALS), which are proteins that bind to IGF-1 in a ternary complex to increase its half-life.2

Like the receptors for other steroid hormones and thyroid hormones, the vitamin D receptor has hormone-binding and DNA-binding domains. The vitamin D receptor forms a complex with another intracellular receptor, the retinoid-X receptor, and that heterodimer is what binds to DNA. In most cases studied, the effect is to activate transcription, but situations are also known in which vitamin D suppresses transcription. Calcitriol increases the serum calcium concentrations by: increasing GI absorption of phosphorus and calcium, increasing osteoclastic resorption, and increasing distal renal tubular reabsorption of calcium. Calcitriol appears to promote intestinal absorption of calcium through binding to the vitamin D receptor in the mucosal cytoplasm of the intestine. Subsequently, calcium is absorbed through formation of a calcium-binding protein.

Only one injection is needed for the first 7 days, which replaces the first 7 daily injections of traditional follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). It is a follicle-stimulation hormone (human a-subunit reduced), a combination of follicle stimulation hormone (human ß-subunit reduced) fusion protein with 118-145-chorionic gonadotropin (human ß-subunit) 6. Frequent, repetitive injections increase stress and error rates, and are often a burden for women, leading to therapy noncompliance 13.
The agent comprises an alpha-subunit, which is identical to that of FSH, and a beta-subunit, which is produced by the fusion of the C-terminal peptide from the beta-subunit of chorionic gonadotropin to the beta-subunit of FSH 1.
Corifollitropin alfa serves as a sustained follicle stimulant that has similar pharmacological effects to recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (rFSH), however, with a relatively long elimination half-life, resulting in a longer duration of action. This is achieved using site-directed mutagenesis and gene transfer techniques to create a glycoprotein that consists of an a-subunit that is identical to human follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) noncovalently bound to a ß-subunit comprised of a complete ß-chain of human FSH elongated by the carboxyterminal peptide of the ß-subunit of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) 7. This unit interacts with the FSH receptor 1 to stimulate the release of oocytes.
Corifollitropin alfa does not demonstrate any intrinsic LH/hCG activity 6.

In concert with other cells, including lymphocytes, neutrophils, mast cells, and macrophages, which themselves can secrete additional pro-inflammatory molecules, high concentrations of neutrophils are associated with tissue damage and fibrosis, leading to the symptoms of eosinophilic diseases.1,2,3,4,5
Typically, eosinophils arise from both CD34+ and dual CD34+, IL-5 receptor-positive (IL-5R+) progenitor cells, which is in part mediated by the cytokines IL-5, IL-3, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).4 Although there exists a population of eosinophils that are insensitive to IL-5 levels, the main population of inflammatory eosinophils proliferates and migrates into the tissue in response to IL-5.4 Mepolizumab is a fully-humanized monoclonal IgG1 kappa antibody that binds IL-5 with a dissociation constant of 100 pM, preventing IL-5 from binding to and subsequently activating IL-5R+ cells.6 This reduction lowers circulating blood eosinophil levels and therefore exerts a beneficial effect in eosinophilic disease; the exact mechanistic nature of mepolizumab action has not been definitively determined.1,2,3,4,5,6 Not all patients will benefit from mepolizumab treatment, such as those with milder asthma or those with a sub-type of HES that is independent of IL-5 signalling.1,4

In particular, the denaturation of lens proteins may in part be prevented by inhibiting the binding of certain chemicals like cyanates or sugars and 5-hydroxybendazac - the major metabolite of bendazac - has been shown to be capable of inhibiting the glycosylation of lens proteins by sugars like galactose or glucose-6-phosphate in a dose-dependent manner 2. Moreover, the apparent ability for administered bendazac to elicit free radical scavenger activities due to interactions with protein molecules suggests that the medication may also be able to prevent the oxidation of lens proteins by free radicals in the development of cataracts 1,2. Furthermore, bendazac may also be capable of reducing the sulfhydryl group oxidation of lens proteins by the saliva, serum, or urine from patients with cataracts following single dose administration and reduce biological liquid oxidant activity (BLOA) in doing so 2.
Otherwise, it is believed that bendazac also possesses non-steroidal anti-inflammatory actions, as well as analgesic, antipyretic, and platelet-inhibitory effects 13,9 These effects may be accounted for in part by the substance's capability to inhibit prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting cyclooxygenase activity in converting arachidonic acid to cyclic endoperoxides - the precursors of prostaglandins 13,9.

The alternative complement system pathway is spontaneously activated due to the absence of CD55, leading to activation of a C3 convertase that that cleaves C3 into C3a and C3b.1 C3b binds to factor B, which is cleaved by factor D into the smaller Ba and larger Bb.2 The resulting C3bBb can bind to other C3 proteins, leading to a positive feedback loop of complement activation.2 C3b proteins can also bind directly to a target cell, marking it as a target for phagocytosis.4 CD55, also known as decay-accelerating factor (DAF) disrupts the formation of C3bBb, preventing spontaneous activation of the alternative complement pathway.2
C3b cleaves C5 into C5a and C5b.1 C5b combines with complement proteins C6, C7, C8, and C9 to form the membrane attack complex (MAC).2 The MAC is a pore formed in the cell by 16 C9 proteins associated with C5b, C6, C7, and C8.3 Formation of pores destroys the cell membrane leading to cell death.3 CD59 disrupts the formation of the MAC, preventing hemolysis.1
In patients with PNH, extravascular hemolysis is mediated by C3b marking red blood cells for phagocytosis, and intravascular hemolysis is mediated by the MAC.5,7 Pegcetacoplan binds to C3 and C3b, reducing cleavage and activation of complement pathways, reducing both extravascular and intravascular hemolysis.7

It was previously thought that, due to its lipophilicity, clofazimine participated in the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) via redox cycling, specifically H2O2 and superoxide, which then exerted an antimicrobial effect.2 A more recent and compelling theory involves clofazimine interacting with bacterial membrane phospholipids to generate antimicrobial lysophospholipids - bactericidal efficacy may, then, arise from the combined membrane-destabilizing effects of both clofazimine and lysophospholipids, which interfere with K+ uptake and, ultimately, ATP production.2,5
The anti-inflammatory activity of clofazimine is the result of its inhibition of T-lymphocyte activation and proliferation.5 Several mechanisms have been proposed, including direct antagonism of T-cell Kv 1.3 potassium channels and indirect action by promoting the release of E-series prostaglandins and reactive oxygen species from bystander neutrophils and monocytes.

Protease inhibitors are used as a part of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in patients diagnosed with HIV infection. It has been shown to effectively suppress the virus, leading to significantly decreased morbidity and mortality rates.5
Darunavir, a HIV protease inhibitor, prevents HIV replication through binding to the enzyme, stopping the dimerization and the catalytic activity of HIV-1 protease. In particular, it inhibits the cleavage of HIV encoded Gag-Pol proteins12 in cells that have been infected with the virus, halting the formation of mature virus particles, which spread the infection. The close contact that darunavir makes with the primary chains of the active site amino acids (Asp-29 and Asp-30) on the protease likely contributes to its potency and efficacy against resistant variants of HIV-1.5
Darunavir is known to bind to different sites on the enzyme: the active site cavity and the surface of one of the flexible flaps in the protease dimer. Darunavir can adapt to changes in the shape of a protease enzyme due to its molecular flexibility.5,9

The binding of insulin to the alpha subunit of IR stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity intrinsic to the beta subunit of the receptor. The bound receptor autophosphorylates and phosphorylates numerous intracellular substrates such as insulin receptor substrates (IRS) proteins, Cbl, APS, Shc and Gab 1. Activation of these proteins leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules including PI3 kinase and Akt. Akt regulates the activity of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and protein kinase C (PKC), both of which play critical roles in metabolism and catabolism. In humans, insulin is stored in the form of hexamers; however, only insulin monomers are able to interact with IR. Substitution of the arginine at position B3 for lysine and replacement of the B29 lysine with glutamic acid decreases the propensity to form hexamers, stabilizes the hormone in monomeric form and results in a rapid rate of absorption and short duration of action.

G-CSF is an endogenous haematopoietic growth factor that stimulates granulopoietic cells of the neutrophil lineage. Pegfilgrastim mimics its biological actions and binds to the same G-CSF receptor expressed on cells of myeloid lineage, such as granulocytic precursors and mature neutrophils.1 Upon binding of the ligand, G-CSF receptor undergoes a conformational change and activates several downstream signalling pathways including JAK/STAT, PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK.5 These pathways work to increase proliferation and differentiation of granulocyte progenitor cells, induce maturation of the progenitor cells, and enhance survival and function of mature neutrophils.1

Selpercatinib is a direct RET kinase inhibitor, exhibiting IC50 values between 0.92 and 67.8 nM depending on the exact RET genotype.7 Information based on natural as well as induced resistance mutations and molecular modelling suggests that selpercatinib directly inhibits RET autophosphorylation by competing with ATP for binding. Various single amino acid mutations at position 810 inhibit selpercatinib binding without significantly altering ATP binding, potentially leading to treatment failures.3
Selpercatinib is also reported to inhibit other tyrosine kinase receptors, including VEGFR1, VEGFR3, FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3, at clinically relevant concentrations. The significance of these effects is not well studied.7

Cancer cells promote tumor angiogenesis by releasing VEGF, resulting in the creation of an immature and disorganized vascular network.9,10 The hypoxic microenvironment promoted by cancer cells favors the survival of more aggressive tumor cells, and gives rise to a challenging environment for immune cells to respond appropriately.10,11,12 As a result, VEGF has become a well-known target for anti-cancer drugs like bevacizumab.6 Bevacizumab is a mAb that exerts its effects by binding and inactivating serum VEGF.14 When bound to the mAb, VEGF is unable to interact with its cell surface receptors, and proangiogenic signalling is inhibited.14 This prevents formation of new blood vessels, decreases tumor vasculature, and reduces tumor blood supply.14,25
There is also evidence to suggest that VEGF is upregulated in COVID-19 patients, hence, bevacizumab is being investigated for the treatment of associated complications.26 Higher levels of VEGF may contribute to pulmonary edema, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and acute lung injury (ALI).26 Researchers are hopeful that by inhibiting VEGF, bevacizumab may effectively treat ARDS and ALI - both common features of severe COVID-19 cases.26

Amivantamab targets both EGFR and MET, preventing ligands from binding to the receptors, blocking signalling, marking the cancerous cells for antibody-dependant cellular cytotoxicity by natural killer cells, and allowing macrophages to perform trogocytosis.9
Amivantamab's binding to the EGFR H epitope shares some of the same amino acids that cetuximab binds to.1
Amivantamab's binding to the alpha chain of MET stabilizes the Sema domain loop 1 to 2 in a position 6 Angstroms away from the position it would be in under normal binding, preventing its interaction with the hepatocyte growth factor's (HGF) beta chain.1 Another smaller conformational change in the MET Sema domain loop 1 to 3 also contributes to preventing the interaction of the MET Sema domain with HGF's beta chain.1 HGF is no longer able to bind to MET, preventing downstream signalling.1
Amivantamab's Fc portion contains 90% less fucose than normal antibodies, allowing for increased binding to the Fc<U+03B3>RIIIa region.4 Binding of the Fc portion of Amivantamab signals the complement system and innate immune system to target the bound cells for complement-dependent cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis.4 Binding of amivantamab to the Fc receptor also leads to and increase in levels of IFN<U+03B3>.6
Amivantamab also significantly downregulates the expression of EGFR and MET on NSCLC cell surfaces, further reducing downstream signalling.6,7 EGFR and MET on the cell surface are internalized, and possibly degrading by fusing endosomes with lysosomes.6 Alternatively, EGFR and MET are the subjects of monocyte-dependent trogocytosis.7 Trogocytosis allows monocytes to internalize and break down EGFR and MET from the NSCLC cells without cytotoxicity, downmodulating EGFR and MET receptors.7

In vitro studies have not demonstrated antagonism between tigecycline and other commonly used antibacterial drugs. In general, tigecycline is considered bacteriostatic.

This results in decreased levels of prostaglandins that mediate pain, fever and inflammation. Ketoprofen is a non-specific cyclooxygenase inhibitor and inhibition of COX-1 is thought to confer some of its side effects, such as GI upset and ulceration. Ketoprofen is thought to have anti-bradykinin activity, as well as lysosomal membrane-stabilizing action. Antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in an increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation.

Silver sulfadiazine acts only on the cell membrane and cell wall to produce its bactericidal effect. A specific mechanism of action has not been determined, but silver sulfadiazine's effectiveness may possibly be from a synergistic interaction, or the action of each component. Silver is a biocide, which binds to a broad range of targets. Silver ions bind to nucleophilic amino acids, as well as sulfhydryl, amino, imidazole, phosphate, and carboxyl groups in proteins, causing protein denaturation and enzyme inhibition.
Silver binds to surface membranes and proteins, causing proton leaks in the membrane, leading to cell death.
Sulfadiazine is a competitive inhibitor of bacterial para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), a substrate of the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. The inhibited reaction is necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid.

Amprenavir interferes with this process by binding to the active site of HIV-1 protease, thereby preventing the processing of viral Gag and Gag-Pol polyprotein precursors, resulting in the formation of immature non-infectious viral particles.

Lapatinib inhibits ERBB-driven tumor cell growth in vitro and in various animal models. An additive effect was demonstrated in an in vitro study when lapatinib and 5-florouracil (the active metabolite of capecitabine) were used in combination in the 4 tumor cell lines tested. The growth inhibitory effects of lapatinib were evaluated in trastuzumab-conditioned cell lines. Lapatinib retained significant activity against breast cancer cell lines selected for long-term growth in trastuzumab-containing medium in vitro. These in vitro findings suggest non-cross-resistance between these two agents.

In Escherichia coli, fosfomycin gains entry into bacterial cells via two mechanisms: the L-alpha-glycerophosphate system and the hexose-6-phosphate transporter system.1

It is applied topically in the form of a drop or it can be injected intravenously to produce a fluorescein angiogram. Topical fluorescein is a useful tool in the diagnosis of corneal abrasions, corneal ulcers, herpetic corneal infections, and dry eye. Fluorescein angiography is used to diagnose and categorize macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, inflammatory intraocular conditions, and intraocular tumors.

Included in the over 45 genes commonly mutated in MDS patients are those involved in DNA methylation and histone modification, and it is well-established that alteration of the epigenetic landscape is a feature of myeloid leukemias.9,10
Decitabine is considered a prodrug, as it requires transport into cells and subsequent phosphorylation by distinct kinases to generate the active molecule 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine-triphosphate, which is incorporated by DNA polymerase during DNA replication.3,5,6,7,8,11 Once incorporated into DNA, decitabine is recognized as a substrate by DNA methyltransferase enzymes (DNMTs), specifically DNMT1, but due to the presence of an N5 rather than C5 atom, traps the DNMT through the irreversible formation of a covalent bond.6,7 At low concentrations, this mode of action depletes DNMTs and results in global DNA hypomethylation while at high concentrations, it additionally results in double-strand breaks and cell death.4,7,8
The general hypothesis regarding decitabine's therapeutic efficacy is that the global hypomethylation it induces results in the expression of previously silent tumour suppressor genes.1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,11 However, there are other putative mechanisms also related to this change in DNA methylation, including indirect alteration of transcription through effects on transcription factors, indirectly altering histone modifications and chromatin structure, and activating pathways involved in DNA damage response.3,5,7,8 The overall effect of decitabine is a decrease in neoplastic cell proliferation and an increase in the expression of tumour suppressor genes.

Clotrimazole causes inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis, an essential constituent of fungal cell membranes. If ergosterol synthesis is either completely or partially inhibited, the cell is no longer able to construct an intact and functional cell membrane 12,13. Because ergosterol directly promotes the growth of fungal cells in a hormone-like fashion, rapid onset of the above events leads to dose-dependent inhibition of fungal growth 2.
Though decreased ergosterol, due to the inhibition of lanosterol 14-demethylase (also known as CYP51) 2 is accepted to be primarily responsible for the antimycotic properties of clotrimazole, this drug also shows other pharmacological effects. These include the inhibition of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, depletion of intracellular calcium, and blocking of calcium-dependent potassium channels and voltage-dependent calcium channels 2. The action of clotrimazole on these targets accounts for other effects of this drug that are separate from its antimycotic activities 2.

IL-5 is a proinflammatory cytokine responsible for the terminal maturation of eosinophils and increases chemotaxis, endothelial adhesion, activation and survival of eosinophils. Eosinophils are known to play a central role in the pathophysiology of many patients with asthma; upon activation, eosinophils release leukotrienes, platelet activation factor, major basic protein, eosinophil cationic protein, eosinophil peroxidase, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, and other cytokines that are cytotoxic to the bronchial epithelium and lead to airway inflammation and bronchospasm 1. IL-5 production is increased by upon activation of TH2 lymphocytes after antigen exposure and IL-5 stimulates the production and maturation of eosinophil precursors in the bone marrow 1. IL-5 promotes the growth and differentiation, recruitment, activation, and survival of eosinophils via interacting with the IL-5 receptor expressed on the eosinophil surface Label. Increased production and activation of eosinophils is especially prominent in nonallergic forms of asthma 1.
Reslizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that occupies the region ERRR (glutamic acid, arginine, arginine, arginine) corresponding to amino acids 89–92 on IL-5, which is a region critical for its interaction with the IL-5 receptor on the eosinophil surface 1. By binding to IL-5 and disrupting its binding to the alpha chain of the IL-5 receptor complex, reslizumab inhibits the bioactivity of IL-5 and attenuates IL-5 signaling. Blocking of IL-5 signalling thereby reduces the production and survival of eosinophils and inhibits eosinophilic-driven inflammation.

It is an agonist of the VR1 (vanilloid/TRPV1 receptor) 10. It serves as a transient agonist of these receptors, which are potentiated by pro-inflammatory drugs, a phenomenon that leads to thermal hyperalgesia, or increased heat sensation 9.
Nonivamide has been shown to stimulate afferent neurons with about half the potency of Capsaicin. Agonism of the VR1 (TRPV1) (vanilloid) receptor by Nonivamide was demonstrated to induce the release of Ca2+ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of human lung cells, producing ER stress and cell death MSDS.
Nonivamide, like other capsaicinoids, acts on the vanilloid receptors located in the peripheral afferent nerve fibers, providing short-acting irritant and algesic properties. Applied dermally, these substances act by stimulating sensitive chemoreceptors of the skin and by reflex, hyperemia and a local elevation in temperature. After repetitive administration, capsaicinoids have been reported to lead to desensitization to nociceptive stimuli possibly by long-acting depletion of peptide neurotransmitters (substance P) from peripheral sensory neurons. Capsaicinoids can modulate muscle tone (in bladder, bronchus etc.). Intravenous injection of nonivamide to rats (10 µg/kg) has been found to lead to bradycardia. The cardiovascular effects are partly explained by substance P release. Nonivamide given to rats subcutaneously (1 mg/kg) was found to cause body temperature decrease, vasodilatation, and increased salivation. Capsaicinoids have shown to illicit bronchospastic effects in guinea pigs. Capsaicin and its analogs were reported to increase barbiturate sleeping time in rats by interacting with hepatic metabolizing enzymes 15.

These BMP receptors are expressed on the surface of mesenchymal cells and upon binding of BMP-2 to the BMP receptor type II, type II receptor phosphorylates and activates type I receptor. Type I receptor may also undergo autophosphorylation. Activated BMP type I receptor then phosphorylates intracellular effector proteins, the receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) 2. Smad1, Smad 5 and Smad 8 associate with the Co-Smad, Smad4 and once activated via complex formation, they translocate to the nucleus where they associate with other transcription factors and bind promoters of target genes to control their expression 2. This ultimately results in bone formation at the site of implantation. Dibotermin alfa causes mesenchymal cells to differentiate into cartilage- and bone-forming cells. Implantation of dibotermin alfa in trabecular bone results in transient resorption of the bone surrounding the implant, followed by replacement of degraded matrix by newly differentiated cells 5.
In human bone cells isolated from adult mandibulae, recombinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2) was shown to stimulate the activity of early biomarkers of osteoblast differentiation, including alkaline phosphatase and parathyroid hormone (PTH)-dependent 3', 5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate accumulation 3. At concentrations of 500 ng/mL, rhBMP-2 also enhanced the mRNA expression level of PTH/PTH related-peptide receptor in human bone cells 3. There was evidence that rhBMP-2 inhibits 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3-induced osteocalcin synthesis at both the mRNA and protein level. rhBMP-2 also significantly suppressed MMP-1 production and MMP-1 mRNA expression at concentrations exceeding 500 ng/mL 3.

It is reported also an inhibitory activity in the toll-like receptor 4 which will later inhibit inflammatory cytokines, NFkB and MyD88. This activity suggests a modulation of the MAP kinase pathway. On the other hand, some reports have pointed out an induction on the PKC/PI3K/Akt pathway in neuroblastoma.4

In lactotrophs, stimulation of dopamine D2 receptor causes inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, which decreases intracellular cAMP concentrations and blocks IP3-dependent release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Decreases in intracellular calcium levels may also be brought about via inhibition of calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels, rather than via inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Additionally, receptor activation blocks phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK and decreases MAPK/ERK kinase phosphorylation. Inhibition of MAPK appears to be mediated by c-Raf and B-Raf-dependent inhibition of MAPK/ERK kinase. Dopamine-stimulated growth hormone release from the pituitary gland is mediated by a decrease in intracellular calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels rather than via adenylyl cyclase inhibition. Stimulation of dopamine D2 receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway leads to improvements in coordinated muscle activity in those with movement disorders.

Although favipiravir was originally developed to treat influenza, the RdRp catalytic domain (favipiravir's primary target), is expected to be similar for other RNA viruses.7 This conserved RdRp catalytic domain contributes to favipiravir's broad-spectrum coverage.7

Interestingly, it is likely that thiazide-like diuretics such as indapamide have additional blood pressure lowering mechanisms that are unrelated to diuresis.8 This is exemplified by the observation that the antihypertensive effects of thiazides are sustained 4-6 weeks after initiation of therapy, despite recovering plasma and extracellular fluid volumes.8
Some studies have suggested that indapamide may decrease responsiveness to pressor agents while others have suggested it can decrease peripheral resistance.2 Although it is clear that diuresis contributes to the antihypertensive effects of indapamide, further studies are needed to investigate the medication’s ability to decrease peripheral vascular resistance and relax vascular smooth muscle.2

This leads to diminished actions of catecholamines, which normally bind to adrenergic receptors and exert sympathetic effects leading to an increase in blood pressure and heart rate.6 Beta(1)-receptor blockade by timolol leads to a decrease in both heart rate and cardiac output during rest and exercise, and a decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.7,8 In addition to this, a reduction in reflex orthostatic hypotension may also occur. The blockade of beta(2) receptors by timolol in the blood vessels leads to a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance, reducing blood pressure.16,17,19
The exact mechanism by which timolol reduces ocular pressure is unknown at this time, however, it likely decreases the secretion of aqueous humor in the eye.18 According to one study, the reduction of aqueous humor secretion may occur through the decreased blood supply to the ciliary body resulting from interference with the active transport system or interference with prostaglandin biosynthesis.4

Tramadol binds weakly to <U+03BA>- and d-opioid receptors and to the µ-opioid receptor with 6000-fold less affinity than morphine.16
Tramadol exists as a racemic mixture consisting of two pharmacologically active enantiomers that both contribute to its analgesic property through different mechanisms: (+)-tramadol and its primary metabolite (+)-O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) are agonists of the µ opioid receptor while (+)-tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and (-)-tramadol inhibits norepinephrine reuptake. These pathways are complementary and synergistic, improving tramadol's ability to modulate the perception of and response to pain.12
In animal models, M1 is up to 6 times more potent than tramadol in producing analgesia and 200 times more potent in µ-opioid binding.29
Tramadol has also been shown to affect a number of pain modulators including alpha2-adrenoreceptors, neurokinin 1 receptors, the voltage-gated sodium channel type II alpha subunit17, transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1 - also known as the capsaicin receptor)18, muscarinic receptors (M1 and M3), N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (also known as the NMDA receptor or glutamate receptor)19, Adenosine A1 receptors20, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.26
In addition to the above neuronal targets, tramadol has a number of effects on inflammatory and immune mediators involved in the pain response. This includes inhibitory effects on cytokines, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), nuclear factor-<U+03BA>B, and glial cells as well as a change in the polarization state of M1 macrophages.16

Binding of benzodiazepines to this receptor complex promotes binding of GABA, which in turn increases the conduction of chloride ions across the neuronal cell membrane. This increased conductance raises the membrane potential of the neuron resulting in inhibition of neuronal firing. In addition, different GABAA receptor subtypes have varying distributions within different regions of the brain and therefore control distinct neuronal circuits. Hence, activation of different GABAA receptor subtypes by benzodiazepines may result in distinct pharmacological actions.

It is estimated that the activity of GLP-1 and GIP contribute more than 70% to the insulin response to an oral glucose challenge. They stimulate insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner via G-protein-coupled GIP and GLP-1 receptor signalling. In addition to their effects on insulin secretion, GLP-1 is also involved in promoting islet neogenesis and differentiation, as well as attenuating pancreatic beta-cell apoptosis. Incretin hormones also exert extra-pancreatic effects, such as lipogenesis and myocardial function.3 In type II diabetes mellitus, GLP-1 secretion is impaired, and the insulinotropic effect of GIP is significantly diminished.2
Vildagliptin exerts its blood glucose-lowering effects by selectively inhibiting dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), an enzyme that rapidly truncates and inactivates GLP-1 and GIP upon their release from the intestinal cells. DPP-4 cleaves oligopeptides after the second amino acid from the N-terminal end. Inhibition of DPP-4 substantially prolongs the half-life of GLP-1 and GIP, increasing the levels of active circulating incretin hormones.3 The duration of DPP-4 inhibition by vildagliptin is dose-dependent.5 Vildagliptin reduces fasting and prandial glucose and HbA1c. It enhances the glucose sensitivity of alpha- and beta-cells and augments glucose-dependent insulin secretion. Fasting and postprandial glucose levels are decreased, and postprandial lipid and lipoprotein metabolism are also improved.2,4

PARPs were evaluated as novel anticancer therapeutic targets after discovering that PARP-1 inhibitors reduce tumour growth in BRCA-deficient cancers.1 BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumour suppressor genes involved in various cellular processes related to cell growth and death, including DNA repair.3 More specifically, BRCA1 and BRCA2 are involved in homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair. Cancer cells with a deleterious BRCA mutation are HR-deficient, resulting in unregulated and aberrant cell repair and growth.1
Rucaparib inhibits PARP1, PARP2, and PARP3.6 Inhibiting PARP traps the enzyme on damaged DNA, halting the repair process and forming toxic PARP–DNA complexes. Alternatively, other DNA repair processes such as error-prone nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or alternative end-joining pathways can be initiated, leading to mutations or chromosomal change.2 Further DNA damage can trigger cancer cell apoptosis and cell death.6
Typically, inhibition of PARP converts single-strand breaks in DNA to double-strand breaks at replication forks. HR DNA repair pathways repair double-strand breaks; however, HR-deficient cancer cells lack this repair mechanism. Because HR-deficient cancer cells are more vulnerable to unsalvageable DNA damage, rucaparib-induced PARP inhibition leads to synthetic lethality. In this phenomenon, two non-lethal defects (HR deficiency and PARP inhibition) combine and cause cell death.1,2

Several mechanisms of action have been proposed. For instance, glatiramer acetate binds strongly to several major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules on MBP-specific antigen-presenting cells, preventing MBP from stimulating these cells.2,7 Glatiramer acetate also has the ability to shift the immune system from a pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory pattern. It inhibits the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-12, IFN<U+03B3>, TNF) released by T helper 1 (Th1) cells, and induces T helper 2 (Th2) suppressor cells that are able to cross the blood-brain barrier and produce anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-10, TGF-ß).6,7 It has also been suggested that glatiramer acetate induces the production of T-regulatory cells associated with the suppression of MS, such as CD4+, CD8+ and CD4+CD25+ cells.1,7

Rosuvastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL).44 The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL. 
In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that rosuvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.25 This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.
Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to ß2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.39
Rosuvastatin exerts an anti-inflammatory effect on rat mesenteric microvascular endothelium by attenuating leukocyte rolling, adherence and transmigration.11 The drug also modulates nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression and reduces ischemic-reperfusion injuries in rat hearts.1 Rosuvastatin increases the bioavailability of nitric oxide11,7,1 by upregulating NOS3 and by increasing the stability of NOS through post-transcriptional polyadenylation.6 It is unclear as to how rosuvastatin brings about these effects though they may be due to decreased concentrations of mevalonic acid.

GABAARs comprise a variety of subunits from a homologous family whose members are named based on sequence identity as one of a1-6, ß1-3, <U+03B3>1-3, d, e, <U+03B8>, p, and <U+03C1>1-3. Each subunit possesses an extracellular (ECD), transmembrane (TMD), and intracellular (ICD) domain; inter-subunit interfaces are the primary points of neurotransmitter and modulator binding, described by coordination of the principal (+) and complementary (-) sites in each subunit. Binding of GABA to GABAARs induces pore opening, rapid flow of chloride ions, and synaptic hyperpolarization, which in turn manifests as an inhibitory signal.8,9
The most prevalent GABAARs in vivo are the a1ß2<U+03B3>2 receptors, which contain both GABA (ß+/a-) and benzodiazepine (BZD, a+/<U+03B3>-) binding sites in the intersubunit interfaces of the relevant subunits.8,9,10 In general, any receptors containing an ax/<U+03B3>z interface, where x = 1-3,5 and z = 1-3, have potential high-affinity BZD binding sites, although small sequence differences between subunits may alter binding affinity to individual molecules. The a4 and a6 subunits, in which an otherwise conserved histidine is replaced by arginine, do not bind traditional BZD ligands such as diazepam and hence are considered \diazepam-insensitive\.8,9,10 GABA binding results in a series of conformational changes in the ECDs of GABAAR ß subunits, \locking\ each to its neighbouring a- interface. The binding of alprazolam in the high-affinity BZD site stabilizes the a+/<U+03B3>- interface and facilitates the conformational changes that lead to pore opening, hence functioning as a positive allosteric modulator.11
The exact manner in which GABAAR allosteric modulation mediates the therapeutic and unwanted effects of benzodiazepines remains unclear.3,4 Earlier studies suggested that the primary factor was the a subunit composition, with a1-containing receptors mediating the sedative effects, a2/3-containing receptors the anxiolytic effects, and a5-containing receptors the memory effects of benzodiazepines.12 More recent studies suggest a more complex set of factors including subunit composition, physiological location, neuronal circuit, and nerve cell type.13 To further complicate matters, there may be up to five distinct BZD binding sites on GABAARs, with site 1 corresponding to the classical high-affinity a+/<U+03B3>- interface. The effects of binding at sites 2-4 are not fully understood and likely impart greater complexity to benzodiazepine pharmacological action.9,10

Characterized by higher-than-normal levels of blood glucose, T2DM is a complex disorder that arises from the interaction between genetic, environmental and behavioral risk factors. Insulin is a peptide hormone that plays a critical role in regulating blood glucose levels. In response to high blood glucose levels, insulin promotes the uptake of glucose into the liver, muscle cells, and fat cells for storage. Although there are multiple events occurring that lead to the pathophysiology of T2DM, the disorder mainly involves insulin insensitivity as a result of insulin resistance, declining insulin production, and eventual failure of beta cells of pancreatic islets that normally produce insulin.5 Early management with lifestyle intervention, such as controlled diet and exercise, is critical in reducing the risk of long-term secondary complications, such as cardiovascular mortality.
Glipizide, like other sulfonylurea drugs, is an insulin secretagogue, which works by stimulating the insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells thereby increasing the plasma concentrations of insulin.4 Thus, the main therapeutic action of the drug depends on the functional beta cells in the pancreatic islets.8 Sulfonylureas bind to the sulfonylurea receptor expressed on the pancreatic beta-cell plasma membrane, leading to the closure of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel and reduced potassium conductance. This results in depolarization of the pancreatic beta cell and opening of the voltage-sensitive calcium channels, promoting calcium ion influx. Increased intracellular concentrations of calcium ions in beta cells stimulates the secretion, or exocytosis, of insulin granules from the cells.Label,6 Apart from this main mechanism of action, the blood-glucose-lowering effect of glipizide involves increased peripheral glucose utilization via stimulating hepatic gluconeogenesis and by increasing the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors.4

Some binding to ß2 and possibly ß3 receptors can still occur at therapeutic dosages but the effects mediated by antagonizing these are significantly reduced from those of non-selective agents. ß1 and ß2 receptors are Gs coupled therefore antagonism of their activation reduces activity of adenylyl cyclase and its downstream signalling via cyclic adenosime monophosphate and protein kinase A (PKA). 
In cardiomyocytes PKA is thought to mediate activation of L-type calcium channels and ryanodine receptors through their phosphorylation.16 L-type calcium channels can then provide an initial rise in intracellular calcium and trigger the ryanodine receptors to release calcium stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and increased contractility. PKA also plays a role in the cessation of contraction by phosphorylating phospholamban which in turn increases the affinity of SR Ca2+ ATPase to increase reuptake of calcium into the SR. It also phophorylates troponin I to reduce affinity of the protein for calcium. Both of these events lead to a reduction in contraction which, when coupled with the initial increase in contraction, allows for faster cycling and consequently higher heart rate with increased contractility. L-type calcium channels are also a major contributor to cardiac depolarization and their activation can increase frequency of action potentials and possibly the incidence of ectopic potentials.17
Similar inihibitory events occur in the bronchial smooth muscle to mediate relaxation including phosphorylation of myosin light-chain kinase, reducing its affinity for calcium.18 PKA also inhibits the excitatory Gq coupled pathway by phosphorylating the inositol trisphosphate receptor and phospholipase C resulting in inhibition of intracellular calcium release. Antagonism of this activity by beta-blocker agents like atenolol can thus cause increased bronchoconstriction.

Animal research studies have demonstrated that carbamazepine exerts its effects by lowering polysynaptic nerve response and inhibiting post-tetanic potentiation. In both cats and rats, carbamazepine was shown to decrease pain caused by infraorbital nerve stimulation. A decrease in the action potential in the nucleus ventralis of the thalamus in the brain and inhibition of the lingual mandibular reflex were observed in other studies after carbamazepine use. Carbamazepine causes the above effects by binding to voltage-dependent sodium channels and preventing action potentials, which normally lead to stimulatory effects on nerves.8,15 In bipolar disorder, carbamazepine is thought to increase dopamine turnover and increase GABA transmission, treating manic and depressive symptoms.19
A common issue that has arisen is resistance to this drug in up to 30% of epileptic patients, which may occur to altered metabolism in patients with variant genotypes.13 A potential therapeutic target to combat carbamazepine resistance has recently been identified as the EPHX1 gene promoter, potentially conferring resistance to carbamazepine through methylation.14

RAR-alpha and RAR-beta have been associated with the development of acute promyelocytic leukemia and squamous cell cancers, respectively. RAR-gamma is associated with retinoid effects on mucocutaneous tissues and bone. Although the exact mechanism of action of tretinoin is unknown, current evidence suggests that the effectiveness of tretinoin in acne is due primarily to its ability to modify abnormal follicular keratinization. Comedones form in follicles with an excess of keratinized epithelial cells. Tretinoin promotes detachment of cornified cells and the enhanced shedding of corneocytes from the follicle. By increasing the mitotic activity of follicular epithelia, tretinoin also increases the turnover rate of thin, loosely-adherent corneocytes. Through these actions, the comedo contents are extruded and the formation of the microcomedo, the precursor lesion of acne vulgaris, is reduced. Tretinoin is not a cytolytic agent but instead induces cytodifferentiation and decreased proliferation of APL cells in culture and in vivo. When Tretinoin is given systemically to APL patients, tretinoin treatment produces an initial maturation of the primitive promyelocytes derived from the leukemic clone, followed by a repopulation of the bone marrow and peripheral blood by normal, polyclonal hematopoietic cells in patients achieving complete remission (CR). The exact mechanism of action of tretinoin in APL is unknown.

Based on modeling studies, dasatinib is predicted to bind to multiple conformations of the ABL kinase. In vitro, dasatinib was active in leukemic cell lines representing variants of imatinib mesylate sensitive and resistant disease. Dasatinib inhibited the growth of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cell lines overexpressing BCR-ABL. Under the conditions of the assays, dasatinib was able to overcome imatinib resistance resulting from BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations, activation of alternate signaling pathways involving the SRC family kinases (LYN, HCK), and multi-drug resistance gene overexpression.

There is some evidence that cyclobenzaprine exerts its effects at the supraspinal level, specifically within the locus coeruleus of the brainstem, with little-to-no action at neuromuscular junctions or directly on skeletal musculature16,10. Action on the brainstem is thought to result in diminished activity of efferent alpha and gamma motor neurons, likely mediated by inhibition of coeruleus-spinal or reticulospinal pathways, and ultimately depressed spinal cord interneuron activity.10
More recently it has been suggested that inhibition of descending serotonergic pathways in the spinal cord via action on 5-HT2 receptors may contribute to cyclobenzaprine’s observed effects.3,10,4

IVIg also impacts different effector cells of the immune system (B and T lymphocytes, dendritic cells, etc.) and regulates a wide range of genes. Its main mechanism of actions are believed to be Fc-dependent and F(ab')2-dependent. IVIg competitively blocks gamma Fc receptors, preventing the binding and ingestion of phagocytes and suppressing platelet depletion. IVIg contains a number of different antobodies, which prevent infection by attaching to the surface of invading pathogens and aiding in their disposal before they can infect cells. Antibodies remove pathogens via complement activation, agglutination or precipitation, pathogen receptor blocking, macrophage “tagging” or neutralization (via binding) of pathogen toxins. Intact IVIg and F(ab')2 fragments of IVIg can also neutralize the activity of various autoantibodies. By triggering the production of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, IVIg modulates of the production of cytokines and cytokine antagonists. It also prevents the generation of the C5b-9 membrane attack complex and subsequent complement-mediated tissue damage by binding active complement components.

The mechanism of action of danaparoid resulting in anticoagulant and antithrombic effects involves a complex interaction between 2 components, factor IIa and in particular, factor Xa 3. Via binding to antithrombin and inducing a conformational change 4, danaparoid enhances and catalyzes the the binding of factor Xa to antithrombin, which induces antithrombin-mediated inactivation of factor Xa. This leads to inhibition of thrombin generation and subsequently, thrombus formation 2. Danaparoid also weakly enhances antithrombin III and heparin cofactor II inactivation of factor IIa 2. There is evidence that danaparoid also suppresses the activation of factor IX which, in conjunction with simultaneous inhibition of factor X, may lead to antithrombic effects 3.

The inhibitory potentials produced by GABA neurotransmission play an integral role in the suppression and control of epileptiform nerve firing such as that seen in epilepsy, which makes the GABA system a desirable target in the treatment of epilepsy.
Benzodiazepines are positive allosteric modulators of GABA(A) function. They bind to the interface between alpha (a) and gamma (<U+03B3>) subunits on the receptor, commonly referred to as the benzodiazepine binding site, and modulate the receptor such that its inhibitory response to GABA binding is dramatically increased.2

This causes relaxation of the muscle, thereby increasing the diameter of the airways, which become constricted in asthma and COPD.

Indacaterol also has a high intrinsic efficacy so it is also very rapid acting - onset of action occurs within 5 minutes. 
The pharmacological effects of beta2-adrenoceptor agonist drugs, including indacaterol, are at least in part attributable to stimulation of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to cyclic-3’, 5’-adenosine monophosphate (cyclic monophosphate). Increased cyclic AMP levels cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle. In vitro studies have shown that indacaterol has more than 24-fold greater agonist activity at beta2-receptors compared to beta1-receptors and 20-fold greater agonist activity compared to beta3-receptors. This selectivity profile is similar to formoterol. The clinical significance of these findings is unknown.

Degenerative changes in the endoplasmic reticulum, the mitochondria of the germinal layer, and the subsequent release of lysosomes result in decreased production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the energy required for the survival of the helminth.

After ingestion, allopurinol is metabolized to its active metabolite, oxypurinol (alloxanthine) in the liver 11, which acts as an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase enzyme Label. 
Allopurinol and its active metabolite inhibit xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that converts hypoxanthine to xanthine and xanthine to uric acid. Inhibition of this enzyme is responsible for the effects of allopurinol. This drug increases the reutilization of hypoxanthine and xanthine for nucleotide and nucleic acid synthesis by a process that involves the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRTase). This process results in an increased nucleotide concentration, which causes feedback inhibition of de novo purine synthesis. The end result is decreased urine and serum uric acid concentrations 15, which decreases the incidence of gout symptoms. 
Accompanying the reduction of serum uric acid by allopurinol is an increase in the serum and urine concentrations of hypoxanthine and xanthine (due to inhibition of xanthine oxidase). In the absence of allopurinol, regular urinary excretion of oxypurines almost entirely occurs in the form of uric acid. After the ingestion of allopurinol, the contents of excreted urine are hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid. Because each substance has its own individual solubility, the concentration of uric acid in plasma is decreased without exposing the renal tissues to a high load of uric acid, thereby decreasing the risk of crystalluria. By lowering the uric acid concentration in the plasma below its limits of solubility, allopurinol encourages the dissolution of gout tophi. Although the levels of hypoxanthine and xanthine are found to be increased after allopurinol ingestion, the risk of deposition in renal tissues is less than that of uric acid, as they become more soluble and are rapidly excreted by the kidney 15.

Free testosterone (T) is transported into the cytoplasm of target tissue cells, where it can bind to the androgen receptor, or can be reduced to 5a-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the cytoplasmic enzyme 5a-reductase. DHT binds to the same androgen receptor even more strongly than T, so that its androgenic potency is about 2.5 times that of T. The T-receptor or DHT-receptor complex undergoes a structural change that allows it to move into the cell nucleus and bind directly to specific nucleotide sequences of the chromosomal DNA. The areas of binding are called hormone response elements (HREs), and influence transcriptional activity of certain genes, producing androgen effects.1
Such activities are useful as endogenous androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone are responsible for the normal growth and development of the male sex organs and for maintenance of secondary sex characteristics 11. These effects include the growth and maturation of the prostate, seminal vesicles, penis, and scrotum; the development of male hair distribution, such as facial, pubic, chest, and axillary hair; laryngeal enlargement, vocal cord thickening, and alterations in body musculature and fat distribution 11.
Male hypogonadism, a clinical syndrome resulting from insufficient secretion of testosterone, has two main etiologies 11. Primary hypogonadism is caused by defects of the gonads, such as Klinefelter’s syndrome or Leydig cell aplasia, whereas secondary hypogonadism is the failure of the hypothalamus (or pituitary) to produce sufficient gonadotropins (FSH, LH) 11.

Levodopa itself is the metabolic precursor of dopamine. In Parkinson's disease, dopamine is depleted to a large degree in the striatum, pallidum, and substantia nigra in the central nervous system (CNS) 3,2. The administration of levodopa to treat the disease is subsequently proposed to facilitate raises in the levels of available dopamine in these areas 3,2. The metabolism of levodopa to dopamine occurs via the enzyme dopa decarboxylase, although unfortunately, this metabolism can also occur in extracerebral tissues 3,2. As a result, the full therapeutic effect of an administered dose of levodopa may not be obtained if portions of it are catabolized outside of the CNS and various patient adherence diminishing extracerebral side effects due to the extracerebral presence of dopamine like nausea, vomiting, or even cardiac arrhythmias can also happen 3,2.
Subsequently, a peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor like benserazide, which blocks the extracerebral decarboxylation of levodopa, when administered in combination with levodopa has obvious and significant advantages. Such benefits include reduced gastrointestinal side effects, a more rapid and complete response at the initiation of therapy, and a simpler dosing regimen 3,2.
It is important to note, however, that benserazide is hydroxylated to trihydroxybenzylhydrazine in the intestinal mucosa and the liver 3,2, and that as a potent inhibitor of the aromatic amino acid decarboxylase 3,2,1, it is this trihydroxybenzylhydrazine metabolite of benserazide that mainly protects levodopa against decarboxylation to dopamine in the gut and also around the rest of the body outside of the blood-brain barrier 1.
Regardless, because Parkinson's disease progresses even with the therapy of levodopa and benserazide, this kind of combined therapy is only ever indicated if it is capable of improving the quality of life and adverse effect profile of using such drugs for Parkinson's patients and there is little to be gained by switching to or starting this combination therapy if patients are already being managed with stable, effective, and well-tolerated levadopa-only therapy 3,2.
Finally, it is also proposed that benserazide hydrochloride may be able to treat beta thalassaemia by maintaining the active expression of the gene for fetal hemoglobin so that constant production of fetal hemoglobin may replace the missing adult hemoglobin variation that is characteristic of patients with the condition, thereby decreasing the need for blood transfusion therapy 4.

Eicosapentaenoic acids compete with constitutive levels of arachidonic acid in cell membranes for the same desaturation enzymes and produce 3-series prostaglandins and thromboxanes, and 5-series leukotrienes which have low pro-inflammatory potential. The alteration in leukotriene biosynthesis due to higher concentration of omega-3 fatty acids compared to arachidonic acid underlies the anti-inflammatory effects.
EPA and DHA also give rise to resolvins and related lipid signalling molecules such as protectins via cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways, which have anti-inflammatory effects. They inhibit transendothelial migration of neutrophils and inhibit TNF and IL-1ß production. Omega-3 fatty acids also decrease adhesion molecule expression on leukocytes and on endothelial cells and decrease intercellular adhesive interactions.
Omega-3 (or n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and their metabolites are natural ligands for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma that regulates inflammatory gene expression and NF<U+03BA>B activation. PPAR alpha activation is also associated with induction of COX-2 expression.
The role of EPA and DHA in reducing triglyceride levels include inhibition of acyl-CoA:1,2-diacylglycerol acyltransferase, increased mitochondrial and peroxisomal-beta-oxidation in the liver, decreased lipogenesis in the liver, and increased plasma lipoprotein lipase activity. They also may reduce triglyceride synthesis because they are poor substrates for the enzymes responsible for TG synthesis, and EPA and DHA inhibit esterification of other fatty acids.

In general, like other aminoglycosides, tobramycin is bactericidal and exhibits both immediate and delayed killing, which are attributed to different mechanisms, as outlined below.1,2
Aminoglycosides are polycationic at physiological pH, such that they readily bind to bacterial membranes (\ionic binding\); this includes binding to lipopolysaccharide and phospholipids within the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria and to teichoic acid and phospholipids within the cell membrane of Gram-positive bacteria. This binding displaces divalent cations and increases membrane permeability, which allows aminoglycoside entry.1,3,4,5 Additional aminoglycoside entry (\energy-dependent phase I\) into the cytoplasm requires the proton-motive force, allowing access of the aminoglycoside to its primary intracellular target of the bacterial 30S ribosome.1,5 Mistranslated proteins produced as a result of aminoglycoside binding to the ribosome (see below) integrate into and disrupt the cell membrane, which allows more of the aminoglycoside into the cell (\energy-dependent phase II\).1,5,6 Hence, tobramycin and other aminoglycosides have both immediate bactericidal effects through membrane disruption and delayed bactericidal effects through impaired protein synthesis; observed experimental data and mathematical modelling support this two-mechanism model.1,2
Inhibition of protein synthesis was the first recognized effect of aminoglycoside antibiotics. Structural and cell biological studies suggest that aminoglycosides bind to the 16S rRNA in helix 44 (h44), near the A site of the 30S ribosomal subunit, altering interactions between h44 and h45. This binding also displaces two important residues, A1492 and A1493, from h44, mimicking normal conformational changes that occur with successful codon-anticodon pairing in the A site.7,8 Overall, aminoglycoside binding has several negative effects, including inhibiting translation initiation and elongation and ribosome recycling.1,9,10 Recent evidence suggests that the latter effect is due to a cryptic second binding site situated in h69 of the 23S rRNA of the 50S ribosomal subunit.8,10 Also, by stabilizing a conformation that mimics correct codon-anticodon pairing, aminoglycosides promote error-prone translation;11 mistranslated proteins can incorporate into the cell membrane, inducing the damage discussed above.1,6
Although direct mutation of the 16S rRNA is a rare resistance mechanism, due to the gene being present in numerous copies, posttranscriptional 16S rRNA modification by 16S rRNA methyltransferases (16S-RMTases) at the N7 position of G1405 or the N1 position of A1408 are common resistance mechanisms in aminoglycoside-resistant bacteria.1,12 These mutants also further support the proposed mechanism of action of aminoglycosides. Direct modification of the aminoglycoside itself through acetylation, adenylation, and phosphorylation by aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AMEs) are also commonly encountered resistance mutations.1,12 Finally, due to the requirement for active transport of aminoglycosides across bacterial membranes, they are not active against obligately anaerobic bacteria.1

Membrane depolarization stimulates calcium ion influx through voltage-sensitive calcium channels. This increase in intracellular calcium ion concentration induces the secretion of insulin.

Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) production and release is also increased by gonadorelin, but to a lesser degree. In prepubertal females and some gonadal function disorders, the FSH response may be greater than the LH response. For the treatment of amenorrhea, delayed puberty, and infertility the administration of gonadorelin is used to simulate the physiologic release of GnRH from the hypothalamus in treatment of delayed puberty, treatment of infertility caused by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and induction of ovulation in those women with hypothalamic amenorrhea. This results in increased levels of pituitary gonadotropins LH and FSH, which subsequently stimulate the gonads to produce reproductive steroids.

Flunisolide binds to plasma transcortin, and it becomes active when it is not bound to transcortin.

Neovascularization is characterized by aberrated proliferation of abnormal vessels in the choroid capillary matrix. As a member of the VEGF family, VEGF-A is a key regulator of vascular permeability and angiogenesis;2 thus, it has been studied as a therapeutic target for the treatment of a wide array of neovascular eye diseases, including neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy.7 For example, increased VEGF-A levels in the vitreous were shown in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration.5
Ranibizumab is a recombinant humanized IgG1 kappa isotype monoclonal antibody directed against human VEGF-A.5 Ranibizumab binds to VEGF-A with high affinity as well as its biologically active forms, such as VEGF165, VEGF121, and VEGF110.4 Notably, VEGF165 is the most predominant isoform in the human eye that promotes ocular neovascularization. VEGF165 enhances vascular permeability, inhibits apoptosis, and causes endothelial-cell mobilization from the bone marrow and differentiation for angiogenesis.2 Ranibizumab binds to the receptor-binding site of VEGF-A, preventing it from binding to its receptors - VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 - that are expressed on the surface of endothelial cells. Ranibizumab thereby attenuates endothelial cell proliferation, vascular leakage, and new blood vessel formation.7

More specifically, bupropion binds to the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and the dopamine transporter (DAT).8,12
Bupropion was originally classified as an \atypical\ antidepressant because it does not exert the same effects as the classical antidepressants such as Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs), Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs), or Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). While it has comparable effectiveness to typical first-line options for the treatment of depression such as SSRIs,9,10 bupropion is a unique option for the treatment of MDD as it lacks any clinically relevant serotonergic effects, typical of other mood medications, or any effects on histamine or adrenaline receptors.8,16 Lack of activity at these receptors results in a more tolerable side effect profile; bupropion is less likely to cause sexual side effects, sedation, or weight gain as compared to SSRIs or TCAs, for example.10,11
When used as an aid to smoking cessation, bupropion is thought to confer its anti-craving and anti-withdrawal effects by inhibiting dopamine reuptake, which is thought to be involved in the reward pathways associated with nicotine, and through the antagonism of the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor (AChR), thereby blunting the effects of nicotine.15,1,14 Furthermore, the stimulatory effects produced by bupropion in the central nervous system are similar to nicotine's effects, making low doses of bupropion a suitable option as a nicotine substitute.23
When used in combination with naltrexone in the marketed product Contrave<U+24C7> for chronic weight management, the two components are thought to have effects on areas of the brain involved in the regulation of food intake. This includes the hypothalamus, which is involved in appetite regulation, and the mesolimbic dopamine circuit, which is involved in reward pathways.24 Studies have shown that the combined activity of bupropion and naltrexone increase the firing rate of hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and blockade of opioid receptor-mediated POMC auto-inhibition, which are associated with a reduction in food intake and increased energy expenditure.24,20,22 This combination was also found to reduce food intake when injected directly into the ventral tegmental area of the mesolimbic circuit in mice, which is an area associated with the regulation of reward pathways.24

The major pharmacological actions of epoprostenol is ultimately inhibition of platelet aggregation. Prostacycline (PGI2) from endothelial cells activate G protein-coupled receptors on platelets and endothelial cells. This activation causes adenylate cyclase to produce cyclic AMP which inhibits further platelet activation and activates protein kinase A. Cyclic AMP also prevents coagulation by preventing an increase in intracellular calcium from thromboxane A2 binding. PKA then continues the cascade by phosphorylating and inhibiting myosin light-chain kinase which leads to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. Notably, PGI2 and TXA2 work as physiological antagonists.

Fluocinonide binds to the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid production. Cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed, potentiating the effect. In another words, the two main products in inflammation Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils, macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding. Like other glucocorticoid agents Fluocinolone acetonide acts as a physiological antagonist to insulin by decreasing glycogenesis (formation of glycogen). It also promotes the breakdown of lipids (lipolysis), and proteins, leading to the mobilization of extrahepatic amino acids and ketone bodies. This leads to increased circulating glucose concentrations (in the blood). There is also decreased glycogen formation in the liver.

Studies show that acetylcholine (ACh) is involved in the modulation of acquisition, encoding, consolidation, reconsolidation, extinction, and retrieval of memory. The gradual loss of cholinergic neurons in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) may, therefore, contribute to the memory loss exhibited by AD patients.8
Acetylcholinesterase is secreted by cholinergic neurons to rapidly hydrolyze ACh at the synaptic cleft to release acetate and choline. Choline is later recycled back into the presynaptic cholinergic neuron via reuptake by the high-affinity choline transporter. There is some evidence demonstrating the potential involvement of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme in the formation of amyloid fibrils.8 Galantamine competitively and reversibly inhibits the anticholinesterase enzyme in the CNS (namely in the frontal cortex and hippocampal regions) 3 by binding to the choline-binding site and acyl-binding pocket of the enzyme active site.2 By blocking the breakdown of ACh, galantamine enhances ACh levels in the synaptic cleft.8
Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) in the CNS are mostly expressed at the presynaptic neuronal membrane to control the release of multiple neurotransmitters, such as ACh, glutamate, GABA, dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine.7,8 Agonists of nAChRs improve performance in cognitive tasks, while antagonists of nAChR impair cognitive processes.8 Some studies show a decrease in the expression and activity of nAChRs in patients with AD, which may explain the reduction in central cholinergic neurotransmission in these patients.3 Galantamine binds to nAChRs at the allosteric site,7,9 leading to a conformational change of the receptor, increased ACh release, and increased activity of neighbouring glutaminergic and serotoninergic neurons.7 The modulation of nAChRs facilitates both excitatory and inhibitory cholinergic transmissions in brain tissues and increases receptor sensitivity. The modulated release of other neurotransmitters by galantamine may also contribute to the upregulation of nAChRs and amelioration of behavioural symptoms in AD.7

These neurons project to aminergic neurons, such as histaminergic or noradrenergic neurons, that are responsible for the effects of orexin and control of wakefulness.4 Histamine H3 receptors are presynaptic inhibitory autoreceptors 6 that are located in the cerebral cortex, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and basal ganglia.5 H3 receptors promote the re-uptake of histamine at synaptic terminals and attenuate further histamine release into the synapse.4 By blocking H3 autoreceptors and increasing the levels of histamine transmitters at the synapse, pitolisant enhances the activity of histaminergic neurons and promotes wakefulness.8 Inverse agonism of pitolisant at H3 receptors also leads to enhanced synthesis and release of endogenous histamine over the basal level.4
Pitolisant acts as a high-affinity competitive antagonist (Ki 0.16 nM) and as an inverse agonist (EC50 1.5 nM) at the human H3 receptor 1 and mediates its pharmacological action at the presynaptic level.5 It is thought to bind to the antagonist binding site of the H3 receptor, which is located within the transmembrane core just below the extracellular loops. Piperidines form a salt bridge with Glu206 in the membrane-spanning segment, and the hydroxyl of Tyr374 is H-bonded with the central oxygen of piperidine.4 Pitolisant displays high selectivity for H3 receptors compared to other histamine receptor subtypes. Pitolisant also modulates acetylcholine, noradrenaline and dopamine release in the brain by increasing the levels of neurotransmitters but does not increase dopamine release in the stratal complex, including the nucleus accumbens.8 At lower nanomolar concentrations, pitolisant acts as an inverse agonist at H3 receptors and enhances the release of endogenous histamine over the basal level.4

Other suggested mechanisms include the regulation of cellular membrane calcium transport and of intracellular concentrations of cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate. Dinoprostone also appears to produce local cervical effects including softening, effacement, and dilation.

When activated, presynaptic 5-HT1A autoreceptors causes neuron hyperpolarization and reduces the firing rate of the serotonergic neuron, thereby decreasing extracellular 5-HT levels in the neuron's projection areas. Activated postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors promote hyperpolarization to released 5-HT on pyramidal neurons.8
The anxiolytic action of buspirone is mainly thought to arise from the interaction at presynaptic 5-HT1A autoreceptors. Acting as a potent agonist in these receptors, buspirone initially causes activation of these autoreceptors and inhibition of 5-HT release. It is proposed that buspirone induces desensitization of somatodendritic autoreceptors over time, which may explain the delayed onset of action of the drug. Desensitization of the autoreceptors ultimately results in heightened excitation of serotonergic neurons and enhanced 5-HT release.9 Buspirone also displays a weak affinity for serotonin 5HT2 receptors and acts as a weak antagonist on dopamine D2 autoreceptors,10 although there is not much evidence that the action at these receptors contribute to the anxiolytic effect of buspirone.6 It acts as an antagonist at presynaptic dopamine D3 and D4 receptors and may bind to alpha-1 adrenergic receptors as a partial agonist.4

After activation by adenosine kinase to ribavirin mono-, di-, and triphosphate metabolites. Ribavirin triphosphate (RTP) is the predominant metabolite which directly inhibits viral mRNA polymerase by binding to the nucleotide binding site of the enzyme. This prevents the binding of the correct nucleotides, leading to a reduction in viral replication or to the production of defective virions 7. RTP also demonstrates an inhibitory action on viral mRNA guanylyltransferase and mRNA 2'-O-methyltransferase of dengue virus. Inhibition of these enzymes disrupts the posttranslational capping of the 5' end of viral mRNA through ribavirin being incorporated at the 5' end in place of guanosine and preventing the cap methylation step. 
Inhibition of host inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) and subsequent depletion of GTP pool is proposed to be another mechanism of action of ribavirin. IMPDH catalyzes the rate-limiting step where inosine 5'-monophosphate is converted to xanthine monophosphate during guanosine monophosphate (GMP) synthesis. GMP is later converted to guanosine triphoshpate (GTP). Ribavirin monophosphate mimics inosine 5'-monophosphate and acts as a competitive inhibitor of IMPDH. Inhibited de novo synthesis of guanine nucleotides and decreased intracellular GTP pools leads to a decline in viral protein synthesis and limit replication of viral genomes 7.
Ribavirin acts as a mutagen in the target virus to cause an 'error catastrophe' due to increased viral mutations. RTP pairs with cytidine triphosphate or uridine triphosphate with equal efficiency and to block HCV RNA elongation. It causes premature termination of nascent HCV RNA and increases mutagenesis by producing defective virions 7.
Ribavirin also exerts an immunomodulatory action of the host to the virus by shifting a Th2 response in favor of a Th1 phenotype. Th2 response and production of type 2 cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 stimulates the humoral response which enhances immunity toward the virus 7. Ribavirin enhanced induction of interferon-related genes, including the interferon-a receptor, and down-regulation of genes involved in interferon inhibition, apoptosis, and hepatic stellate cell activation in vitro 6.

L-arginine is in turn responsible for citrulline's therapeutic affects. Many of L-arginine's activities, including its possible anti-atherogenic actions, may be accounted for by its role as the precursor to nitric oxide or NO. NO is produced by all tissues of the body and plays very important roles in the cardiovascular system, immune system and nervous system. NO is formed from L-arginine via the enzyme nitric oxide synthase or synthetase (NOS), and the effects of NO are mainly mediated by 3',5' -cyclic guanylate or cyclic GMP. NO activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic GMP from guanosine triphosphate or GTP. Cyclic GMP is converted to guanylic acid via the enzyme cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase. NOS is a heme-containing enzyme with some sequences similar to cytochrome P-450 reductase. Several isoforms of NOS exist, two of which are constitutive and one of which is inducible by immunological stimuli. The constitutive NOS found in the vascular endothelium is designated eNOS and that present in the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system is designated nNOS. The form of NOS induced by immunological or inflammatory stimuli is known as iNOS. iNOS may be expressed constitutively in select tissues such as lung epithelium. All the nitric oxide synthases use NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) and oxygen (O2) as cosubstrates, as well as the cofactors FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide), FMN (flavin mononucleotide), tetrahydrobiopterin and heme. Interestingly, ascorbic acid appears to enhance NOS activity by increasing intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin. eNOS and nNOS synthesize NO in response to an increased concentration of calcium ions or in some cases in response to calcium-independent stimuli, such as shear stress. In vitro studies of NOS indicate that the Km of the enzyme for L-arginine is in the micromolar range. The concentration of L-arginine in endothelial cells, as well as in other cells, and in plasma is in the millimolar range. What this means is that, under physiological conditions, NOS is saturated with its L-arginine substrate. In other words, L-arginine would not be expected to be rate-limiting for the enzyme, and it would not appear that supraphysiological levels of L-arginine which could occur with oral supplementation of the amino acid would make any difference with regard to NO production. The reaction would appear to have reached its maximum level. However, in vivo studies have demonstrated that, under certain conditions, e.g. hypercholesterolemia, L-arginine could enhance endothelial-dependent vasodilation and NO production.

Corticosteroids like betamethasone can act through nongenomic and genomic pathways.3 The genomic pathway is slower and occurs when glucocorticoids activate glucocorticoid receptors and initiate downstream effects that promote transcription of anti-inflammatory genes including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), IL-1-receptor antagonist, and tyrosine amino transferase (TAT).3 On the other hand, the nongenomic pathway is able to elicit a quicker response by modulating T-cell, platelet and monocyte activity through the use of existing membrane-bound receptors and second messengers.3

HER2 becomes active following dimerization with another HER2 receptor, another member of the HER protein family (e.g. HER3), or with a ligand - this dimer then phosphorylates and activates numerous intracellular signaling proteins, initiating signal transduction via pathways that include the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, the phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, and then Janus kinases/signal transducer and activator transcription pathway.2 HER2 is also a known oncogene - it is overexpressed or gene-amplified (i.e. HER2-positive) in approximately 20% of breast cancers and these cancers carry a generally poorer prognosis than HER2-negative breast cancers.2
Pertuzumab targets the extracellular dimerization domain (subdomain II) of HER2, thereby inhibiting ligand-initiated intracellular signaling via the MAP kinase and PI3K pathways. Inhibition of these pathways results in inhibition of cell growth and the initiation of apoptosis, respectively.5 Pertuzumab also appears to mediate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.5

In general, the progression of anesthesia is related to the diameter, myelination and conduction velocity of affected nerve fibers.10 Clinically, the order of loss of nerve function is as follows: (1) pain, (2) temperature, (3) touch, (4) proprioception, and (5) skeletal muscle tone.10
While it is well-established that the main action of bupivacaine is through sodium channel block, additional analgesic effects of bupivacaine are thought to potentially be due to its binding to the prostaglandin E2 receptors, subtype EP1 (PGE2EP1), which inhibits the production of prostaglandins, thereby reducing fever, inflammation, and hyperalgesia.3,4

After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid production. The cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed, potentiating the effect. In other words, the two main products in inflammation Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils, macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding.

By inhibiting intracellular cyclic AMP and Ca2+ and by a receptor-linked distal effect on exocytosis, SSTRs block cell secretion 3. The common pathway shared by the receptors involve the activation of phosphotyrosine phosphatase (PTP), and modulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 3. With the exception of SSTR3, activation of SSTRs lead to activation of voltage-gated potassium channels accompanied by increased K+ currents. This result in membrane hyperpolarization and inhibits depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx through voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels 1. Depending on the receptor subtype, signalling cascades involve activation of other downstream targets such as Na+/H+ exchanger, Rho GTPase, and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) 1. SSTRs 1 to 4 bind both somatostatin isoforms with equal nanomolar binding affinity whereas SSTR5 exhibits a 5- to 10-fold higher binding affinity for SST-28 1. 
Effects of SSTR1: Upon biding of somatostatin and activation, SSTR1 mediates an antisecretory effect on growth hormone, prolactin and calcitonin 1. 
Effects of SSTR2: SSTR2 subtype dominates in endocrine tissues. By binding to SST2 receptors, somatostatin exerts paracrine inhibitory actions on gastrin release from G cells, histamine release from ECL cells, and directly on parietal cell acid output 9. SSTR2 receptor signalling cascades also inhibit the secretion of growth hormone and that of adrenocorticotropin, glucagon, insulin, and interferon-<U+03B3> 1. 
Effects of SSTR3: Activation of these receptors lead to reduction in cell proliferation 1. SSTR3 triggers PTP-dependent cell apoptosis accompanied by activation of p53 and the pro-apoptotic protein Bax 3. A study of the matrigel sponge assay suggests that through SSTR3-mediated inhibition of both NOS and MAPK activities may lead to the antitumor effects of somatostatin in inhibiting tumor angiogenesis 8.
Effects of SSTR4: The functions of SSTR4 remain largely unknown 1.
Effects of SSTR5: Like SSTR2, SSTR5 subtype also predominates in endocrine tissues. Upon activation, SSTR5 signalling cascades exert an inhibitory action on growth hormone, adrenocorticotropin, insulin, and glucagon-like peptide-1 as well as the secretion of amylase 1.
The presence of somatostatin receptors has been identified in most neuroendocrine tumours, endocrine gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) tumors, paragangliomas, pheochromocytomas, medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC) and small cell lung carcinomas 7. The antitumor effects of somatostatin were also effective in various malignant lymphomas and breast tumours 7. Gastrointestinal hormones, such as gastrin, secretin, and cholecystokinin (CCK), as well as growth hormones and growth factors are thought to be elevated in gastrointestinal tract and neuroendocrine tumours and are inhibited by somatostatin 4. In vitro, somatostatin inhibited epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced DNA synthesis and replication following which suggest that somatostatin may have direct anti-proliferative effects via SSTR signalling 4. Acromegaly is characterized as the endocrine disorder caused by a functioning tumour of cells that secrete growth hormone from the anterior pituitary 9. Somatostatin analogue therapies serve to normalize the elevated levels of GH and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and attenuate tumour growth. 
In the vascular system this likely produces vasoconstriction by inhibiting adenylate cyclase leading to a lowering the concentration of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in the endothelial cells which ultimately blocks vasodilation through this pathway. This vasoconstriction is though the be responsible for reducing blood flow to the esophageal tissues and so reduces bleeding from esophageal varices 2. 
Somatostatin mediates an analgesic activity by reducing vascular and nociceptive components of inflammation 6. Studies indicate that somatostatin may be present in nociceptive DRG neurons with C-fibers and primary afferent neurons to inhibit the release of transmitters at the presynaptic junctions of the sensory-efferent nerve terminals 1. Exogenous somatostatin has shown to inhibit the release of Substance P from central and peripheral nerve ending 1.

The intracellular triphosphate of penciclovir is retained in vitro inside HSV-infected cells for 10-20 hours, compared with 0.7-1 hour for acyclovir. in vitro studies show that penciclovir triphosphate selectively inhibits viral DNA polymerase by competing with deoxyguanosine triphosphate. Inhibition of DNA synthesis of virus-infected cells inhibits viral replication. In cells not infected with HSV, DNA synthesis is unaltered. Resistant mutants of HSV can occur from qualitative changes in viral thymidine kinase or DNA polymerase. The most commonly encountered acyclovir-resistant mutants that are deficient in viral thymidine kinase are also resistant to penciclovir.

This alteration in pain mechanisms is due to many of the following: temporary loss of membrane potential, inability to transport neurotrophic factors leading to altered phenotype, and reversible retraction of epidermal and dermal nerve fiber terminals.

DACs, also known as histone DACs (HDAC), are responsible for regulating the acetylation of about 1750 proteins in the body; their functions are involved in many biological processes including DNA replication and repair, chromatin remodelling, transcription of genes, progression of the cell-cycle, protein degradation and cytoskeletal reorganization. In multiple myeloma, there is an overexpression of DAC proteins. Panobinostat inhibits class I (HDACs 1, 2, 3, 8), class II (HDACs 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10) and class IV (HDAC 11) proteins. Panobinostat's antitumor activity is believed to be attributed to epigenetic modulation of gene expression and inhibition of protein metabolism. Panobinostat also exhibits cytotoxic synergy with bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor concurrently used in treatment of multiple myeloma.

However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. Their primary target is the cytosolic glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes.

Although the exact mechanism of action has not been fully determined, evidence shows that cladribine is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase to the nucleotidecladribine triphosphate (CdATP; 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate), which accumulates and is incorporated into DNA in cells such as lymphocytes that contain high levels of deoxycytidine kinase and low levels of deoxynucleotidase, resulting in DNA strand breakage and inhibition of DNA synthesis and repair. High levels of CdATP also appear to inhibit ribonucleotide reductase, which leads to an imbalance in triphosphorylated deoxynucleotide (dNTP) pools and subsequent DNA strand breaks, inhibition of DNA synthesis and repair, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and ATP depletion, and cell death. Unlike other antimetabolite drugs, cladribine has cytotoxic effects on resting as well as proliferating lymphocytes. However, it does cause cells to accumulate at the G1/S phase junction, suggesting that cytotoxicity is associated with events critical to cell entry into S phase. It also binds purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), however no relationship between this binding and a mechanism of action has been established.

This reduction in prostanoid production is the common mechanism that mediates the effects of nambutone.
PGE2 is the primary PG involved in modulation of nociception.6 It mediates peripheral sensitization through a variety of effects.9,6 PGE2 activates the Gq-coupled EP1 receptor leading to increased activity of the inositol trisphosphate/phospholipase C pathway. Activation of this pathway releases intracellular stores of calcium which directly reduces action potential threshold and activates protein kinase C (PKC) which contributes to several indirect mechanisms. PGE2 also activates the EP4 receptor, coupled to Gs, which activates the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A (AC/PKA) signaling pathway. PKA and PKC both contribute to the potentiation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) potentiation, which increases sensitivity to heat stimuli. They also activate tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channels and inhibit inward potassium currents. PKA further contributes to the activation of the P2X3 purine receptor and sensitization of T-type calcium channels. The activation and sensitization of depolarizing ion channels and inhibition of inward potassium currents serve to reduce the intensity of stimulus necessary to generate action potentials in nociceptive sensory afferents. PGE2 act via EP3 to increase sensitivity to bradykinin and via EP2 to further increase heat sensitivity. Central sensitization occurs in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and is mediated by the EP2 receptor which couples to Gs. Pre-synaptically, this receptor increases the release of pro-nociceptive neurotransmitters glutamate, CGRP, and substance P. Post-synaptically it increases the activity of AMPA and NMDA receptors and produces inhibition of inhibitory glycinergic neurons. Together these lead to a reduced threshold of activating, allowing low intensity stimuli to generate pain signals. PGI2 is known to play a role via its Gs-coupled IP receptor although the magnitude of its contribution varies. It has been proposed to be of greater importance in painful inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. By limiting sensitization, both peripheral and central, via these pathways NSAIDs can effectively reduce inflammatory pain.
PGI2 and PGE2 contribute to acute inflammation via their IP and EP2 receptors.9,7 Similarly to ß adrenergic receptors these are Gs-coupled and mediate vasodilation through the AC/PKA pathway. PGE2 also contributes by increasing leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium and attracts the cells to the site of injury.9 PGD2 plays a role in the activation of endothelial cell release of cytokines through its DP1 receptor.7 PGI2 and PGE2 modulate T-helper cell activation and differentiation through IP, EP2, and EP4 receptors which is believed to be an important activity in the pathology of arthritic conditions. By limiting the production of these PGs at the site of injury, NSAIDs can reduce inflammation.
PGE2 can cross the blood-brain barrier and act on excitatory Gq EP3 receptors on thermoregulatory neurons in the hypothalamus.9 This activation triggers an increase in heat-generation and a reduction in heat-loss to produce a fever. NSAIDs prevent the generation of PGE2 thereby reducing the activity of these neurons.
The adverse effects of NSAIDs stem from the protective and regulatory roles of prostanoids which have been well-characterized.9 PGI2 and PGE2 regulate blood flow to the kidney by similar mechanisms to the vasodilation they produce in inflammation. Prevention of this regulation by NSAIDs produces vasoconstriction which limits renal function by reducing blood flow and the hydrostatic pressure which drives filtration. PGE2 also regulates gastric protection via EP3 receptors which are, in this location, coupled to Gi which inhibits the AC/PKA pathway. This reduces the secretion of protons by H+/K+ ATPase in parietal cells and increases the secretion of mucus and HCO3- by superficial endothelial cells. Disruption of this protective action by NSAIDs lead to ulceration of the gastric mucosa. Lastly, disruption of PGI2, which opposes platelet aggregation, generation by COX-2 selective agents leads to an imbalance with TXA2 generated by COX-1, which promotes aggregation of platelets, leading to increased risk of thrombosis. Since nabumetone is somewhat COX-2 selective it is thought to promote this imbalance and increase thrombotic risk.1

Endothelins are released in both a constitutive fashion from secretory vesicles and in response to stimuli via Weibel-Palade storage granules.1 Endothelins bind to the EA and EB receptors, with endothelins -1 and -2 having more affinity than endothelin-3.3 Binding to the Gq coupled EA receptor triggers Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of smooth muscle cells via the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway. Downstream protein kinase C activation may also contribute to increased Ca2+ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus. EA receptor activation is also known to contribute to pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation. The binding of endothelins to the EB receptors acts in opposition to EA signaling by activating the same PLC cascade in endothelial cells to activate endothelial nitric oxide synthase. The subsequent release of nitric oxide produces vasodilation through the cyclic guanosine monophosphate cascade.1 Despite the greater presence of EB receptors on endothelial cells, they are still present on smooth muscle cells and may contribute to cell proliferation through the same mechanisms as EA receptors.3 Macitentan is thought to provide its therapeutic effect primarily via blocking signaling through EA which produces both decreased vasoconstriction via reduced smooth muscle cell contractility and attenuation of the hyperproliferation of smooth muscle cells found in PAH. Blockade of EB is less likely to contribute to a therapeutic effect as this signaling is responsible for the counter-regulatory vasodilatory signal.

The direct action of angiotensin II on surrounding vessel walls is facilitated by binding to the G-protein-coupled angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT-1) on vascular smooth muscle cells, which stimulates Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation of myosin and causes smooth muscle contraction that results in vasoconstriction Label,1.
The RAAS is ultimately regulated by a negative feedback effect of angiotensin II on renin production by the juxtaglomerular cells of the renal afferent arteriole. Unresuscitated septic shock associated with marked hypovolemia, extracellular fluid volume depletion, decreased cardiac output, low arterial blood pressure and decreased systemic vascular resistance causes an increase in renin secretion by the juxtaglomerular cells, resulting in elevated angiotensin II plasma levels and an increased secretion of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Angiotensin II binding to AT-1 receptors causes dose-dependent vasoconstriction of both afferent and efferent glomerular arterioles. The most pronounced effect of angiotensin II results on efferent arterioles, resulting in reduced renal blood flow and increased glomerular filtration pressure. 1

Various in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that fenfluramine is capable of acting as an agonist of multiple serotonin receptors including 5-HT1A, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C, as well as a s1 receptor antagonist.1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,16 This is at least partly because fenfluramine, as well as its active metabolite norfenfluramine, can act on sodium-dependent serotonin transporters (SERTs) to reverse transport direction and thereby increase extracellular serotonin levels.14,15 However, work in animal models of Dravet syndrome suggest that only the modulation of 5-HT1D, 5-HT2C, s1, and possibly 5-HT2A receptors of fenfluramine result in the anti-epileptiform activity.3,5,8 Interestingly, 5-HT2B receptor agonism, which had previously been associated with cardiac valvulopathy,12,13 is not anticipated to have any therapeutic value in Dravet syndrome.8
Although the exact mechanism by which stimulation/inhibition of various receptors leads to the observed therapeutic benefit is unclear, it is hypothesized to be two-fold. Stimulation of 5-HT1D and 5-HT2C may result in increased GABAergic neurotransmission, while s1 receptor antagonism may help to modulate responses to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA).8

It should be noted that when given to patients with aplastic anemia, other lineages besides platelet count were increased, suggesting that either eltrombopag enhanced the effect of TPO in vivo; or there is a yet uncovered mechanism of action at work.

It binds to GABA-A receptors containing any of the a, ß, <U+03B3>, or d-subunits but displays strongest potency when bound to receptors containing a3 or d subunits 4. Stiripentol is an inhibitor of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), which plays a physiological role in energy metabolism of neurons and regulation of neuronal excitation. It binds to the site separate from lactate and pyruvate binding sites of the enzyme and inhibits both pyruvate-to-lactate conversion and lactate-to-pyruvate conversion 3. LDH inhibitors including stiripentol as antiepileptic treatments mimic ketogenic diet, where the energy source in the brain is switched from glucose to mainly ketone bodies. The ketone bodies directly regulate neuronal excitation and seizures via ATP-sensitive potassium channels and vesicular glutamate transporters 3. As a potent inhibitor of hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, mainly CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, stiripentol co-administration with other antiepileptic drugs elevates the free unchanged active drugs (such as carbamazepine, sodium valproate, phenytoin, phenobarbital and many benzodiazepines) in the circulation to mediate their therapeutic actions.

After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid production. The cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed, potentiating the effect. In other words, the two main products in inflammation Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils, macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding.

The main source of estrogen in adult women during the reproductive period of life is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol each day. After menopause, however, the majority of endogenous estrogen is produced by transformation of androstenedione (which is secreted by the adrenal cortex) to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Both estrone and its sulphate conjugated form, estrone sulphate, represent the most abundant estrogens found in postmenopausal women.34
Estradiol, however, is considerably more potent than estrone and estriol at the estrogen receptor (ER). As a result, the higher estrone concentration in postmenopausal population, can cause various undesirable effects. These effects may include hot flashes, chills, vaginal dryness, mood swings, irregular menstruation, and chills, in addition to sleep problems.34
Estradiol workings by binding to subtypes of the estrogen receptor: estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) and estrogen receptor beta (ERß). It also exerts potent agonism of G Protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER), which is recognized an important regulator of this drug's rapid effects. Once the estrogen receptor has bound to its ligand, it enters the nucleus of the target cell, regulating gene transcription and formation of of messenger RNA. This mRNA makes contact with ribosomes producing specific proteins that express the effect of estradiol upon the target cell. Agonism of estrogen receptors increases pro-estrogenic effects, leading to the relief of vasomotor and urogenital symptoms of a postmenopausal or low estradiol state.9,27,31

Previous research indicate that thalidomide binds to cerebron, a component of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, to selectively degrade the transcription factor IKZF3 and IKZF1. These 2 transcription factors are vital for the proliferation and survival of malignant myeloma cells. 2
Regarding TNF-alpha, thalidomide seems to block this mediator via a variety of mechanism. Thalidomide can inhibit the expression myeloid differentiating factor 88 (MyD88), an adaptor protein that is involved in the TNF-alpha production signalling pathway, at the protein and RNA level. Additionally, thalidomide prevents the activation of Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-kB), another upstream effector of the TNF-alpha production pathway. Finally, some evidences suggest that thalidomide can block alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AGP), a known inducer of the NF-kB/MyD88 pathway, thus inhibiting the expression of TNF-alpha 8. The down-regulation of NF-kB and MyD88 can also affect the cross talk between the NF-kB/MyD88 and VEGF pathway, resulting in thalidomide's anti-angiogenic effect. 9

TIMP inhibits several reactions that involve inosinic acid (IMP), such as the conversion of IMP to xanthylic acid (XMP) and the conversion of IMP to adenylic acid (AMP) via adenylosuccinate (SAMP). Upon methylation, TIMP forms 6-methylthioinosinate (MTIMP) which inhibits glutamine-5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase in addition to TIMP. Glutamine-5-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate amidotransferase is the first enzyme unique to the de novo pathway for purine ribonucleotide synthesis. According to experimental findings using radiolabeled mercaptopurine, mercaptopurine may be recovered from the DNA in the form of deoxythioguanosine. In comparison, some mercaptopurine may be converted to nucleotide derivatives of 6-thioguanine (6-TG) via actions of inosinate (IMP) dehydrogenase and xanthylate (XMP) aminase that convert TIMP to thioguanylic acid (TGMP).

These amines are important in regulating mood. The monoamine hypothesis in depression, one of the oldest hypotheses, postulates that deficiencies of serotonin (5-HT) and/or norepinephrine (NE) neurotransmission in the brain lead to depressive effects 9. This drug counteracts these mechanisms, and this may be the mechanism of amitriptyline in improving depressive symptoms.
Whether its analgesic effects are related to its mood-altering activities or attributable to a different, less obvious pharmacological action (or a combination of both) is unknown 6.

This widening of the blood vessels results in a lowering of blood pressure. The action of phentolamine on the alpha adrenergic receptors is relatively transient and the blocking effect is incomplete. The drug is more effective in antagonizing responses to circulating epinephrine and/or norepinephrine than in antagonizing responses to mediator released at the adrenergic nerve ending. Phentolamine also stimulates ß-adrenergic receptors and produces a positive inotropic and chronotropic effect on the heart and increases cardiac output.

It is non-selective for COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes 9,10,11. Inhibition of COX-1 results in the inhibition of platelet aggregation for about 7-10 days (average platelet lifespan). The acetyl group of acetylsalicylic acid binds with a serine residue of the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) enzyme, leading to irreversible inhibition. This prevents the production of pain-causing prostaglandins. This process also stops the conversion of arachidonic acid to thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which is a potent inducer of platelet aggregation Label. Platelet aggregation can result in clots and harmful venous and arterial thromboembolism, leading to conditions such as pulmonary embolism and stroke. 
It is important to note that there is 60% homology between the protein structures of COX-1 and COX-2. ASA binds to serine 516 residue on the active site of COX-2 in the same fashion as its binding to the serine 530 residue located on the active site of COX-1. The active site of COX-2 is, however, slightly larger than the active site of COX-1, so that arachidonic acid (which later becomes prostaglandins) manages to bypass the aspirin molecule inactivating COX-2 11,12. ASA, therefore, exerts more action on the COX-1 receptor rather than on the COX-2 receptor 14. A higher dose of acetylsalicylic acid is required for COX-2 inhibition 15.

This injury to the myocardium raises concentrations of catecholamines, which activate hormone sensitive lipase, and increasing fatty acid concentrations in plasma.5 When the myocardium is repurfused, fatty acid oxidation becomes the dominant form of ATP production, maintaining an acidic pH, and further exacerbating the injury.5
The mechanism of action of trimetazidine is not fully understood.5 Trimetazidine may inhibit mitochondrial 3-ketoacyl coenzyme A thiolase, decreasing long chain fatty acid ß-oxidation but not glycolysis in the myocardium.1,10 The decreased long chain fatty acid ß-oxidation is compensated for by increased use of glucose, preventing a lowered myocardial pH, and further decreases in contractility.1,10 However, another study suggests that 3-ketoacyl coenzyme A thiolase may not be trimetazidine's target, and that this mechanism may be incorrect.5

These compounds elicites smooth muscle activation leading to vasoconstriction. These compounds interact with cell surface adrenergic receptors. Such stimuli result in a signal transduction cascade that leads to increased intracellular calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through IP3 mediated calcium release, as well as enhanced calcium entry across the sarcolemma through calcium channels. The rise in intracellular calcium complexes with calmodulin, which in turn activates myosin light chain kinase. This enzyme is responsible for phosphorylating the light chain of myosin to stimulate cross bridge cycling.
Once elevated, the intracellular calcium concentration is returned to its basal level through a variety of protein pumps and calcium exchangers located on the plasma membrane and sarcoplasmic reticulum. This reduction in calcium removes the stimulus necessary for contraction allowing for a return to baseline. The drug can also cause vesicular displacement of noradrenaline from the neuron into the synapse with a similar effect as tyramine.

As a result, there is a leak of potassium ions which results in the repolarization of cells and a decrease in neuronal excitability. The overall impact is the impairment of neuromuscular transmission as it is harder to trigger an action potential.
Dalfampridine inhibits voltage-gated potassium channels in the CNS to maintain the transmembrane potential and prolong action potential. In other words, dalfampridine works to make sure that the current available is high enough to stimulate conduction in demyelinated axons that are exposed in MS patients. Furthermore, it facilitates neuromuscular and synaptic transmission by relieving conduction blocks in demyelinated axons.

This enzyme cleaves the terminal 2-O-sulfate moieties from the glycosaminoglycans (GAG) dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate. Due to the missing or defective iduronate-2-sulfatase enzyme in patients with Hunter's Syndrome, GAG progressively accumulate in the lysosomes of a variety of cells, leading to cellular engorgement, organomegaly, tissue destruction and organ system dysfunction. Treatment of Hunter's Syndrome patients with idursulfase provides exogenous enzyme for uptake into cellular lysosomes. Targeting of idursulfase to the lysosome occurs by endocytosis from the cell surface. Mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) residues on the oligosaccharide chains allow specific binding of the enzymes to the M6P receptors on the cell surface, leading to cellular internalization of the enzyme, targeting to intracellular lysosomes and subsequent catabolism of accumulated GAG.

ACh signalling via mAChRs located in the central nervous system (CNS) and periphery can regulate smooth muscle contraction, glandular secretions, heart rate, and various neurological phenomena such as learning and memory.2,3 mAChRs can be divided into five subtypes, M1-M5, expressed at various levels throughout the brain.3 Also, M2 receptors are found in the heart and M3 receptors in smooth muscles, mediating effects apart from the direct modulation of the parasympathetic nervous system.4 While M1, M3, and M5 mAChRs primarily couple to Gq proteins to activate phospholipase C, M2 and M4 mainly couple to Gi/o proteins to inhibit adenylyl cyclase and modulate cellular ion flow.3 This system, in part, helps to control physiological responses such as nausea and vomiting.9
Scopolamine acts as a non-selective competitive inhibitor of M1-M5 mAChRs, albeit with weaker M5 inhibition; as such, scopolamine is an anticholinergic with various dose-dependent therapeutic and adverse effects.4,5,6 The exact mechanism(s) of action of scopolamine remains poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests that M1 (and possibly M2) mAChR antagonism at interneurons acts through inhibition of downstream neurotransmitter release and subsequent pyramidal neuron activation to mediate neurological responses associated with stress and depression.7 Similar antagonism of M4 and M5 receptors is associated with potential therapeutic benefits in neurological conditions such as schizophrenia and substance abuse disorders.3 The significance of these observations to scopolamine's current therapeutic indications of preventing nausea and vomiting is unclear but is linked to its anticholinergic effect and ability to alter signalling through the CNS associated with vomiting.5,9

Increased capillary permeability accompanies capillary dilatation, producing an outward passage of plasma protein and fluid into the extracellular spaces, an increase in lymph flow and protein content, and the formation of edema. In addition, histamine has a direct stimulant action on smooth muscle, producing contraction if H 1-receptors are activated, or mostly relaxation if H 2-receptors are activated. Also in humans, the stimulant effect of histamine may cause contraction of the intestinal muscle. However, little effect is noticed on the uterus, bladder, or gallbladder. Histamine has some stimulant effect on duodenal, salivary, pancreatic, bronchial, and lacrimal glands.

The endocannabinoid system is widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system (via the Cannabinoid Receptors CB1 and CB2) and plays a role in many physiological processes such as inflammation, cardiovascular function, learning, pain, memory, stress and emotional regulation, and the sleep/wake cycle among many others 7. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous system, and are most abundant in the hippocampus and amygdala, which are the areas of the brain responsible for short-term memory storage and emotional regulation. CB2 receptors are mainly located in the peripheral nervous system and can be found on lymphoid tissue where they are involved in regulation of immune function 8.

Firstly, DHE's s agonist action on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) 1b receptors in the smooth muscle of the cranial vasculature may provide relief via vasoconstriction of the blood vessels which typically become dilated due to the release of CGRP during migraine attacks. 3,4 DHE's off-target action at alpha-adrenergic receptors may further contribute via this mechanism. The remaining mechanisms are thought to provide relief through the effects on the neurogenic causes of migraine symptoms. Agonist action by DHE on 5-HT1b and 5-HT1d receptors inhibits nociceptive signalling through the ventroposteromedial thalamus to the trigeminal sensory neurons. Further action on 5-HT1b and 5-HT1d receptors with the addition of agonist activity on 5-HT1f in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis decreases afferent signalling to trigeminal sensory neurons which contributes to central sensitization. The success of experimental compounds selectively targetting the 5-HT1f receptor lends support to this mechanism. Lastly, action at 5-HT1d receptors on trigeminal nerve terminals inhibits the release of vasoactive neuropeptides thought to contribute to pain and inflammation during a migraine attack. DHE is known to have 10-fold less potency at the 5-HT1b receptor than its predecessor ergotamine which reduces the incidence of vascular side effects.5 Notably, DHE slowly diffuses from receptors resulting in unreliable prediction of effects from plasma concentration. 4

This drug is centrally acting and leads to a reduction in the release of excitatory amino acids like glutamate and aspartate, which cause neuronal firing that leads to muscle spasm. The above reduction and excitatory neurotransmitter release results in presynaptic inhibition of motor neurons. The strongest effect of tizanidine has been shown to occur on spinal polysynaptic pathways. The anti-nociceptive and anticonvulsant activities of tizanidine may also be attributed to agonist action on Alpha-2 receptors. Tizanidine also binds with weaker affinity to the Alpha-1 receptors, explaining its slight and temporary effect on the cardiovascular system 9.

This increase in PGE2 is associated with a decrease in aquaporin 3 expression in mucosal epithelial cells of the large intestine2. A decrease in aquaporin 3 expression likely produces the laxative effect by restricting water reabsorption by the large intestine thereby increasing fecal water content2.

Under aerobic conditions, bronopol catalyzes the oxidation of thiol groups, such as cysteine, to disulfides. This reaction is accompanied by rapid consumption of oxygen, where oxygen acts as the final oxidant. During the conversion of cysteine to cystine, radical anion intermediates such as superoxide and peroxide are formed from bronopol to exert a direct bactericidal activity. The oxidation of excess thiols alters the redox state to create anoxic conditions, leading to a second reaction involving the oxidation of intracellular thiols such as glutathione to its disulfide. The resulting effects are inhibition of enzyme function, and reduced growth rate following the bacteriostatic period 1. Under the anoxic conditions, the reaction between thiol and bronopol decelerates without the involvement of oxygen and the consumption of bronopol predominates. Bronopol is ultimately removed from the reaction via consumption and resumption of bacterial growth occurs 1.

Verapamil binds to these channels in a voltage- and frequency-dependent manner, meaning affinity is increased 1) as vascular smooth muscle membrane potential is reduced, and 2) with excessive depolarizing stimulus.17
Verapamil's mechanism of action in the treatment of angina and hypertension is likely due to the mechanism described above. Inhibition of calcium influx prevents the contraction of vascular smooth muscle, causing relaxation/dilation of blood vessels throughout the peripheral circulation - this lowers systemic vascular resistance (i.e. afterload) and thus blood pressure. This reduction in vascular resistance also reduces the force against which the heart must push, decreasing myocardial energy consumption and oxygen requirements and thus alleviating angina.19
Electrical activity through the AV node is responsible for determining heart rate, and this activity is dependent upon calcium influx through L-type calcium channels. By inhibiting these channels and decreasing the influx of calcium, verapamil prolongs the refractory period of the AV node and slows conduction, thereby slowing and controlling the heart rate in patients with arrhythmia.19
Verapamil's mechanism of action in the treatment of cluster headaches is unclear, but is thought to result from an effect on other calcium channels (e.g. N-, P-, Q-, or T-type).4
Verapamil is known to interact with other targets, including other calcium channels,14,15,7,8 potassium channels,6,16,4 and adrenergic receptors.11,12

From in vitro studies which indicate that one atom of copper combines with two molecules of penicillamine. Penicillamine also reduces excess cystine excretion in cystinuria. This is done, at least in part, by disulfide interchange between penicillamine and cystine, resulting in formation of penicillamine-cysteine disulfide, a substance that is much more soluble than cystine and is excreted readily. Penicillamine interferes with the formation of cross-links between tropocollagen molecules and cleaves them when newly formed. The mechanism of action of penicillamine in rheumatoid arthritis is unknown although it appears to suppress disease activity. Unlike cytotoxic immunosuppressants, penicillamine markedly lowers IgM rheumatoid factor but produces no significant depression in absolute levels of serum immunoglobulins. Also unlike cytotoxic immunosuppressants which act on both, penicillamine in vitro depresses T-cell activity but not B-cell activity.

Schizophrenia is theorized to be caused by a hyperdopaminergic state within the limbic system of the brain.9 Dopamine-antagonizing medications such as haloperidol, therefore, are thought to improve psychotic symptoms by halting this over-production of dopamine. The optimal clinical efficacy of antipsychotics is associated with the blockade of approximately 60 % - 80 % of D2 receptors in the brain.9
While the exact mechanism is not entirely understood, haloperidol is known to inhibit the effects of dopamine and increase its turnover. Traditional antipsychotics, such as haloperidol, bind more tightly than dopamine itself to the dopamine D2 receptor, with dissociation constants that are lower than that for dopamine.4 It is believed that haloperidol competitively blocks post-synaptic dopamine (D2) receptors in the brain, eliminating dopamine neurotransmission and leading to the relief of delusions and hallucinations that are commonly associated with psychosis. It acts primarily on the D2-receptors and has some effect on 5-HT2 and a1-receptors, with negligible effects on dopamine D1-receptors. The drug also exerts some blockade of a-adrenergic receptors of the autonomic system.13
Antagonistic activity regulated through dopamine D2 receptors in the chemoreceptive trigger zone (CTZ) of the brain renders its antiemetic activity. Of the three D2-like receptors, only the D2 receptor is blocked by antipsychotic drugs in direct relation to their clinical antipsychotic abilities. 
Clinical brain-imaging findings show that haloperidol remains tightly bound to D2 dopamine receptors in humans undergoing 2 positron emission tomography (PET) scans with a 24h pause in between scans.4 A common adverse effect of this drug is the development of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), due to this tight binding of haloperidol to the dopamine D2 receptor.
Due to the risk of unpleasant and sometimes lifelong extrapyramidal symptoms, newer antipsychotic medications than haloperidol have been discovered and formulated. Rapid dissociation of drugs from dopamine D2 receptors is a plausible explanation for the improved EPS profile of atypical antipsychotics such as Risperidone. This is also consistent with the theory of a lower affinity for D2 receptors for these drugs. As mentioned above, haloperidol binds tightly to the dopamine receptor, potentiating the risk of extrapyramidal symptoms,4 and therefore should only been used when necessary.

Cysteine is typically synthesized in the human body when there is sufficient methionine available. Cysteine exhibits antioxidant properties and participates in redox reactions. Cysteine's antioxidant properties are typically expressed in the tripeptide glutathione, which occurs in humans as well as other organisms. Glutathione (GSH) typically requires biosynthesis from its constituent amino acids, cysteine, glycine, and glutamic acid, due to its limited systemic availability. Glutamic acid and glycine are readily available in the diets of most industrialized countries, but the availability of cysteine can be the limiting substrate. In human metabolism, cysteine is also involved in the generation of sulfide present in iron-sulfur clusters and nitrogenase by acting as a precursor. In a 1994 report released by five top cigarette companies, cysteine is one of the 599 additives to cigarettes. Its use or purpose, however, is unknown, like most cigarette additives. Its inclusion in cigarettes could offer two benefits: Acting as an expectorant, since smoking increases mucus production in the lungs; and increasing the beneficial antioxidant glutathione (which is diminished in smokers).

It demonstrates a high affinity for the mu-opioid receptor but has lower intrinsic activity compared to other full mu-opioid agonists such as heroin, oxycodone, or methadone.15 This means that buprenorphine preferentially binds the opioid receptor and displaces lower affinity opioids without activating the receptor to a comparable degree. Clinically, this results in a slow onset of action and a clinical phenomenon known as the \ceiling effect\ where once a certain dose is reached buprenorphine's effects plateau. This effect can be beneficial, however, as dose-related side effects such as respiratory depression, sedation, and intoxication also plateau at around 32mg, resulting in a lower risk of overdose compared to methadone and other full agonist opioids.4,5 It also means that opioid-dependent patients do not experience sedation or euphoria at the same rate that they might experience with more potent opioids, improving quality of life for patients with severe pain and reducing the reinforcing effects of opioids which can lead to drug-seeking behaviours.11
Buprenorphine's high affinity, but low intrinsic activity for the mu-opioid receptor also means that if it is started in opioid-dependent individuals, it will displace the other opioids without creating an equal opioid effect and cause a phenomenon known as \precipitated withdrawal\ which is characterized by a rapid and intense onset of withdrawal symptoms (i.e. anxiety, restlessness, gastrointestinal distress, diaphoresis, intense drug cravings, and tachycardia). Individuals must therefore be in a state of mild to moderate withdrawal before starting therapy with buprenorphine. 
Buprenorphine is commercially available as the brand name product Suboxone which is formulated in a 4:1 fixed-dose combination product along with naloxone, a non-selective competitive opioid receptor antagonist. Combination of an opioid agonist with an opioid antagonist may seem counterintuitive, however this combination with naloxone is intended to reduce the abuse potential of Suboxone, as naloxone is poorly absorbed by the oral route (and has no effect when taken orally), but would reverse the opioid agonist effects of buprenorphine if injected intravenously.14,20,21

There are two identified isoforms of COX: COX-1 is universally present in most body tissues and is involved in the synthesis of the prostaglandins and thromboxane A2, while COX-2 is expressed in response to injury or inflammation.1 Constitutively expressed, the COX-1 enzyme is involved in gastric mucosal protection, platelet, and kidney function by catalyzing the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin (PG) G2 and PGG2 to PGH2.1 COX-2 is constitutively expressed and highly inducible by inflammatory stimuli. It is found in the central nervous system, kidneys, uterus, and other organs. COX-2 also catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGG2 and PGG2 to PGH2. In the COX-2-mediated pathway, PGH2 is further converted to PGE2 and PGI2 (also known as prostacyclin). PGE2 is involved in mediating inflammation, pain, and fever. Decreasing levels of PGE2 leads to reduced inflammatory reactions. Indometacin is known to inhibit both isoforms of COX, however, with greater selectivity for COX-1, which accounts for its increased adverse gastric effects relative to other NSAIDs. It binds to the enzyme's active site and prevents the interaction between the enzyme and its substrate, arachidonic acid. Indometacin, unlike other NSAIDs, also inhibits phospholipase A2, the enzyme responsible for releasing arachidonic acid from phospholipids. The analgesic, antipyretic and anti-inflammatory effects of indomethacin as well as adverse reactions associated with the drug occur as a result of decreased prostaglandin synthesis. Its antipyretic effects may be due to action on the hypothalamus, resulting in increased peripheral blood flow, vasodilation, and subsequent heat dissipation.
The exact mechanism of action of indometacin in inducing closure of a patent ductus arteriosus is not fully understood; however, it is thought to be through inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis.13 At birth, the ductus arteriosus is normally closed as the tension of the oxygen increases significantly after birth.4 Patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants is associated with congenital heart malformations where PGE1 mediates an opposite effect to that of oxygen. PGE1 dilates the ductus arteriosus through smooth muscle relaxation and prevents the closure of the ductus arteriosus.4 By inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins, indometacin promotes the closure of ductus arteriosus.14
Indometacin has been described as possessing anticancer and antiviral properties through activation of protein kinase R (PKR) and downstream phosphorylation of eIF2a, inhibiting protein synthesis.11,12

In target cells, sirolimus binds to the cytoplasmic receptor FK506-binding protein-12 (FKBP12), an immunophilin, to form an immunosuppressive complex. FKBP12-sirolimus complex binds to and inhibits the activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR),2,8 which is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase that regulates cell growth, proliferation, survival, mobility, and angiogenesis.1,2 mTOR regulates the downstream signalling pathways involved in cell survival, such as the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signalling pathway.1 Inhibition of mTOR leads to the suppression of cytokine-driven T-cell proliferation, thus the progression from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle is inhibited. Sirolimus also inhibits antibody production. In vitro, sirolimus and other mTOR inhibitors inhibit the production of certain growth factors that may affect angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, and vascular permeability.8
Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a disorder that primarily affects the lungs. It is characterized by lung tissue infiltration, unregulated alveolar smooth muscle proliferation, and cystic destruction of parenchyma. Although infrequent, it occurs as a symptomatic pulmonary complication in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), which is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in TSC genes.7 Loss of functional TSC gene leads to the aberrant activation of the mTOR signalling pathway, resulting in cellular proliferation and release of lymphangiogenic growth factors. Sirolimus inhibits the activated mTOR pathway and proliferation of alveolar smooth muscle cell proliferation.8

Despite the variety of conditions indicated for treatment with leuprolide, the mechanism of action underlying efficacy is the same in all cases. As a GnRHR agonist, leuprolide binds to and initially activates downstream LH and FSH release; this initial spike in gonadotropin levels is responsible for some of the adverse effects associated with treatment. After 2-4 weeks of treatment, continuous stimulation of GnRHR results in feedback inhibition and significant downregulation of LH, FSH, and their corresponding downstream effects, producing a therapeutic benefit. These effects are reversible upon treatment discontinuation.1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

In particular, these glycoprotein receptors are members of the immunoglobulin supergene family and are related structurally to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) 1. CEA is found naturally in the human body and its expression may be increased in both cancer and non-cancerous (benign) circumstances.
Besilesomab is subsequently a murine immunoglobulin monoclonal antibody of IgG1 isotype designed to recognise and bind specifically to NCA-95, or nonspecific cross-reacting antigen 95, an epitope found expressed on the cell membranes of granulocytes and granulocyte precursors Label.
When radiolabelled with sodium pertechnetate (Tc99m) solution to develop technetium (Tc99m) besilesomab solution, this radiolabelled medicine is injected into patients where the monoclonal antibody carries it to target CEA on target granulocytes Label. When large numbers of CEA expressing granulocytes gather to the site of an infection, the radioactive monoclonal antibodies will also accumulate at such sites, where it can be detected by diagnostic scanning Label. The resultant images show where the radioactive besilesomab has accumulated, locating areas affected by osteomyelitis, infection, or inflammation Label.
Furthermore, it is believed that the besilesomab accumulation is predominantly passive (via increased vascular permeability) and only partially active (via migration of human granulocytes carrying besilesomab to the infection/inflammation location) since only 10% to 20% of the injected radio-diagnostic agent binds in vivo to human circulating granulocytes 4. Specific binding of besilesomab to activated granulocytes that have already migrated to sites of infection/inflammation might be the primary part of the detection signal 4.

These are ionotropic receptors composed up of five homomeric or heteromeric subunits. In the brain, nicotine binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on dopaminergic neurons in the cortico-limbic pathways. This causes the channel to open and allow conductance of multiple cations including sodium, calcium, and potassium. This leads to depolarization, which activates voltage-gated calcium channels and allows more calcium to enter the axon terminal. Calcium stimulates vesicle trafficking towards the plasma membrane and the release of dopamine into the synapse. Dopamine binding to its receptors is responsible the euphoric and addictive properties of nicotine.
Nicotine also binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla. Binding opens the ion channel allowing influx of sodium, causing depolarization of the cell, which activates voltage-gated calcium channels. Calcium triggers the release of epinephrine from intracellular vesicles into the bloodstream, which causes vasoconstriction, increased blood pressure, increased heart rate, and increased blood sugar.

This diuretic effect is achieved through the competitive inhibition of sodium-potassium-chloride cotransporters (NKCC2) expressed along these tubules in the nephron, preventing the transport of sodium ions from the lumenal side into the basolateral side for reabsorption. This inhibition results in increased excretion of water along with sodium, chloride, magnesium, calcium, hydrogen, and potassium ions.10 As with other loop diuretics, furosemide decreases the excretion of uric acid.8
Furosemide exerts direct vasodilatory effects, which results in its therapeutic effectiveness in the treatment of acute pulmonary edema. Vasodilation leads to reduced responsiveness to vasoconstrictors, such as angiotensin II and noradrenaline, and decreased production of endogenous natriuretic hormones with vasoconstricting properties. It also leads to increased production of prostaglandins with vasodilating properties. Furosemide may also open potassium channels in resistance arteries.8 The main mechanism of action of furosemide is independent of its inhibitory effect on carbonic anhydrase and aldosterone.9

Removal of the strong inhibitory feedback mechanism exerted by cortisol results in an increase in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production by the pituitary. With continued blockade of the enzymatic steps leading to production of cortisol and corticosterone, there is a marked increase in adrenocortical secretion of their immediate precursors, 11-desoxycortisol and desoxycorticosterone, which are weak suppressors of ACTH release, and a corresponding elevation of these steroids in the plasma and of their metabolites in the urine. These metabolites are readily determined by measuring urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (17-OHCS) or 17-ketogenic steroids (17-KGS). Because of these actions, metopirone is used as a diagnostic test, with urinary 17-OHCS measured as an index of pituitary ACTH responsiveness. Metopirone may also suppress biosynthesis of aldosterone, resulting in a mild natriuresis.

Therefore, thimerosal may induce or inhibit various cellular functions that are dependent on the signaling of calcium 7.
Ethylmercury is metabolized to inorganic mercury more rapidly than methylmercury. This difference in metabolism may account for kidney pathology that can result from toxic quantities. Also, whereas the increase in oxidative stress and induction of apoptosis observed in vitro with large doses (405 µg/L to 101 mg/L) of thimerosal may explain its damaging neurological effects. The effects of low-dose ethylmercury are not completely understood to date. It is known, however, that the shorter half-life of ethylmercury (the metabolite of thimerosal) allows for very limited opportunities of ethylmercury derived from thimerosal in vaccines 7.
Ethylmercury is a lipophilic cation that is capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier. The octanol/water partition coefficients of methyl and ethylmercury are 1.4 to 1.8, at intracellular pH and [Cl-], therefore, both organomercury compounds will primarily exist as intracellular lipophilic cations. It has been demonstrated that lipophilic cations accumulate inside mitochondria, in a Nernstian fashion, driven by the steady state membrane potential. As the typical mitochondrial membrane potential of astrocytes and neurons is between 140–170 mV, one would expect the concentration of these organomercury compounds within mitochondria to be approximately 1000 times greater than the cytosolic concentration 22.

Specficially, activation is associated with reduction of the mycobacterial ferric KatG catalase-peroxidase by hydrazine and reaction with oxygen to form an oxyferrous enzyme complex. Once activated, isoniazid inhibits the synthesis of mycoloic acids, an essential component of the bacterial cell wall. At therapeutic levels isoniazid is bacteriocidal against actively growing intracellular and extracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis organisms. Specifically isoniazid inhibits InhA, the enoyl reductase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, by forming a covalent adduct with the NAD cofactor. It is the INH-NAD adduct that acts as a slow, tight-binding competitive inhibitor of InhA.

Diastolic excitability threshold is increased and effective refractory period prolonged. Propafenone reduces spontaneous automaticity and depresses triggered activity. At very high concentrations in vitro, propafenone can inhibit the slow inward current carried by calcium but this calcium antagonist effect probably does not contribute to antiarrhythmic efficacy.

Activation of M3 receptors results in ASM contraction and resulting bronchoconstriction through downstream calcium-dependent signalling pathways, while M2 activation inhibits neuronal acetylcholine release.2,3,4
Methacholine is a non-specific mAChR agonist, capable of acting on all mAChR subtypes.5,6,7 However, in the context of AHR, methacholine's ability to induce bronchoconstriction through M3 receptors is clinically relevant.2,4,8 In addition, M3 agonism may increase the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, further contributing to AHR.9 The inhibitory effect of M2 agonism by methacholine is likely also important, as shown by animal studies using mice with impaired M2 function, and by observations that eosinophilic inflammation, such as occurs in asthma, negatively impacts M2 function.3 Hence, asthmatic patients are more sensitive to inhaled cholinergic agonists such as methacholine; this forms the basis for the methacholine challenge test, which diagnoses AHR through an increased methacholine-induced response.10,11

Opioid receptors are involved in various brain signalling pathways, including the mesolimbic pathway, sometimes referred to as the reward pathway. The mesolimbic pathway plays an important role in the positive reinforcement of natural rewards like food and drugs of abuse like exogenous opioid drugs. Many abused drugs activate mu-opioid receptors, leading to positive reinforcing effects.5 Alcohol consumption can also cause the release of endogenous opioids, which bind to mu and delta receptors, thereby increasing the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens to induce reward and positive reinforcement effects.1
Nalmefene is an antagonist at the mu and delta-opioid receptors and a partial agonist at the kappa-opioid receptor. As an antagonist, nalmefene blocks ligands from binding to the opioid receptor.7 Animal studies suggest that kappa-opioid receptor signalling blocks acute reward and positive reinforcement effects of drugs with abusive potential by decreasing dopamine in the nucleus accumbens.1In vivo studies have demonstrated that nalmefene reduces alcohol consumption, possibly by modulating cortico-mesolimbic functions.7 Preclinical studies suggest that nalmefene restores alcohol-induced dysregulations of the MOR/endorphins and the KOR/dynorphin system.3

There are several proposed mechanisms for the anti-inflammatory action of corticosteroids. Corticosteroids may work by increasing the transcription of genes coding for anti-inflammatory proteins, including lipocortin-1 and interleukin-10.4 Corticosteroids were also shown to inhibit the expression of multiple genes that encode pro-inflammatory factors, such as cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules, that are activated during the chronic inflammatory process.5 This is thought to be due to the direct inhibitory interaction between activated glucocorticoid receptors and activated pro-inflammatory transcription factors, such as nuclear factor-kappa B and activator protein-1.4 Chronic inflammation is often characterized by enhanced expression of these transcription factors that bind to and activate coactivator molecules, which then acetylate core histones to switch on gene transcription to further amplify the inflammatory process.5 Corticosteroids suppress the multiple inflammatory gene expression by promoting histone deacetylation, resulting in tighter coiling of DNA and reduced access of transcription factors to their binding sites.4

The “Inositol depletion theory” suggests lithium behaves as an uncompetitive inhibitor of inositol monophosphatase in a manner inversely proportional to the degree of stimulus3. This inhibition lowers levels of inositol triphosphate6. However, stronger inhibitors of inositol monophosphatase are not as clinically effective and low levels of inositol triphosphate are associated with memory impairment3,6.
Lithium acts on inositol polyphosphatase as an uncompetitive inhibitor3. This inhibition is thought to have multiple downstream effects that have yet to be clarified3.
Lithium regulates phosphorylation of GSK-3 which regulates other enzymes through phosphorylation3. Lithium can also inhibit GSK-3 through interfering with the magnesium ion in the active site3.

The sympathetic outflow is regulated by alpha (a)-2 adrenergic receptors and imidazoline receptors expressed on adrenergic neurons within the rostral ventrolateral medulla.2 Methyldopa is metabolized to a-methylnorepinephrine via dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity and, consequently, alpha-methylepinephrine via phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase activity.9,8,10 Mediating the therapeutic effects of methyldopa, a-methylnorepinephrine and a-methylepinephrine active metabolites are agonists at presynaptic alpha-2 adrenergic receptors in the brainstem. Stimulating alpha-2 adrenergic receptors results in the inhibition of adrenergic neuronal outflow and attenuation of norepinephrine release in the brainstem. Consequently, the output of vasoconstrictor adrenergic signals to the peripheral sympathetic nervous system is reduced, leading to a reduction in blood pressure.1
The L-isomer of alpha-methyldopa also reduces blood pressure by inhibiting aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, also known as DOPA decarboxylase, which is an enzyme responsible for the syntheses of dopamine and serotonin.11 Inhibiting this enzyme leads to depletion of biogenic amines such as norepinephrine. However, inhibition of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase plays a minimal role in the blood-pressure-lowering effect of methyldopa.2,3

It has also been hypothesized that L-aspartate can enhance short intensive exercise by serving as a substrate for energy production in the Krebs cycle and for stimulating the purine nucleotide cycle.

The ionotropic ones being non-NMDA (AMPA and kainate) and NMDA receptors. Free glutamic acid cannot cross the blood-brain barrier in appreciable quantities; instead it is converted into L-glutamine, which the brain uses for fuel and protein synthesis. It is conjectured that glutamate is involved in cognitive functions like learning and memory in the brain, though excessive amounts may cause neuronal damage associated in diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, lathyrism, and Alzheimer's disease. Also, the drug phencyclidine (more commonly known as PCP) antagonizes glutamate at the NMDA receptor, causing behavior reminiscent of schizophrenia. Glutamate in action is extremely difficult to study due to its transient nature.

Alternatively, when given as an injection the acetyl groups present in the diamorphine/diacetylmorphine compound confer the substance lipophilicity that facilitates diamorphine's rapid crossing of the blood-brain-barrier 5,6. Once in the brain, diamorphine is metabolised via deacetylation to the active 6-MAM and morphine metabolites as well 5,6. Despite diamorphine possessing little to no opioid agonist activity itself, its rapid transit across the blood-brain-barrier elicits a far faster onset of activity in comparison to the extensive first-pass metabolism of oral administration 5,6. Regardless, the metabolism of diamorphine to morphine makes heroin a prodrug for the delivery of morphine 5,6.
Morphine is subsequently a mu-opioid agonist. It acts on endogenous mu-opioid receptors that are spread in discrete packets throughout the brain, spinal cord and gut in almost all mammals 1. Morphine, along with other opioids, are agonists to four endogenous neurotransmitters 1. They are beta-endorphin, dynorphin, leu-enkephalin, and met-enkephalin 1. The body responds to morphine in the brain by reducing (and sometimes stopping) production of the endogenous opioids when morphine is present 1. Endorphins are regularly released in the brain and nerves, attenuating pain. Their other functions are still obscure, but are probably related to the effects produced by morphine besides analgesia (antitussin, anti-diarrheal) 1.
Nevertheless, morphine ultimately elicits the majority of its analgesic activity by binding to mu opioid receptors in both the central and peripheral nervous systems 7. The overall effect of morphine is activation of descending inhibitory pathways of the central nervous system as well as inhibition of nociceptive afferent neurons of the peripheral nervous system, which results in an overall reduction of the nociceptive pain transmission 7.

Upon ingestion, tibolone is quickly converted into three major metabolites: 3 alpha- and 3 beta-hydroxy-tibolone, which have oestrogenic effects, and the Delta(4)-isomer, which has progestogenic and androgenic effects. The specific tissue-selective effects of tibolone occur due to the metabolism, regulation of enzymes and receptor activation that varies in different tissues of the body.
The bone-conserving effects occur due to estradiol receptor activation, while the progesterone and androgen receptors are not involved in this process. Breast tissue of monkeys is not found to be stimulated after tibolone administration, as occurs with estrogen plus progesterone used in combination. This is explained by the fact that tibolone and its metabolites inhibit sulphatase and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) type I and stimulate sulphotransferase and 17 beta-HSD type II. The combined effects of this process prevent the conversion to active estrogens.
In the uterus, the progestogenic activity of the Delta(4)-metabolite and the effect on estrogen-inactivating enzymes prevent estrogenic stimulation. The mammary gland is not stimulated in currently used animal models. Tibolone has been shown to regulate estrogenic activity in several tissue types by influencing the availability of estrogenic compounds for the estradiol receptor in a selective manner 2.
Additionally, tibolone modulates cellular homeostasis in the breast by preventing breast tissue proliferation and stimulating cell apoptosis. Tibolone does not stimulate the endometrium because of the action of its highly stable progestogenic metabolite (Delta(4)-isomer) in combination with an effect on the sulfatase (inhibition)-sulfotransferase (stimulation) system. The estrogenic metabolites of tibolone have direct, favorable effects on the cardiovascular system and, in animal models, this drug has shown no adverse consequences. 
The tissue-selective effects of tibolone are the result of metabolism, enzyme regulation and receptor activation that vary in different tissues. The bone-preserving effects of tibolone are the result of estradiol receptor activation, while other steroid receptors, mainly the progesterone and androgen receptors, are not involved in this process. 
In a study of monkeys, breast tissue was not stimulated, which occurs with estrogen and progesterone, because tibolone and its metabolites inhibit sulfatase and 17 beta-hydroxysteroid _dehydrogenase (HSD) type I and stimulate _sulfotransferase and 17 beta-HSD type II. The simultaneous effects of this process halt conversion to active estrogens. Additionally, tibolone affects cellular homeostasis in the breast by preventing proliferation and stimulating apoptosis. Tibolone does not stimulate the endometrium due to the action of the highly stable progestogenic metabolite (Delta(4)-isomer) in combination with an effect on the sulphatase (inhibition)-sulphotransferase (stimulation) pathway 1.
The levels of tibolone metabolites and the alteration of hormonal activities vary according to the tissue type. In endometrial tissue the <U+0394>4-isomer functions as a progestagen, however, in the brain and liver, it shows androgenic effects. In breast tissue, the primary actions of tibolone are strong inhibition of sulfatase activity and weak inhibition of 17ß-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity, which leads to blocking the conversion estrone sulfate to E2 4.

Vestibular forms of vertigo are often accompanied by auditory dysfunctions such as hyperacusis, hearing loss, and tinnitus.3 In most cases, adaptive mechanisms of the CNS lead to functional recovery after episodes of vertigo, however, syndromes such as Ménière's disease tend to cause the recurrence of vertigo symptoms. This significantly impacts the quality of life and the ability to carry out daily activities.2
H1-receptor activity
The mechanism of action of betahistine is multifactorial. Ménière's disease is thought to result from a disruption of endolymphatic fluid homeostasis in the ear.6 Betahistine mainly acts as a histamine H1-receptor agonist. The stimulation of H1-receptors in the inner ear causes a vasodilatory effect leading to increased permeability of blood vessels and a reduction in endolymphatic pressure; this action prevents the rupture of the labyrinth, which can contribute to the hearing loss associated with Ménière's disease. Betahistine is also purported to act by reducing the asymmetrical functioning of sensory vestibular organs and increasing vestibulocochlear blood flow, relieving symptoms of vertigo.5
H3-receptor activity
In addition to the above mechanisms, betahistine also acts as a histamine H3-receptor antagonist, increasing the turnover of histamine from postsynaptic histaminergic nerve receptors, subsequently leading to an increase in H1-agonist activity. H3-receptor antagonism elevates levels of neurotransmitters including serotonin in the brainstem, inhibiting the activity of vestibular nuclei, thus restoring proper balance and decreasing vertigo symptoms.3

Phenytoin is often described as a non-specific sodium channel blocker and targets almost all voltage-gated sodium channel subtypes.7 More specifically, phenytoin prevents seizures by inhibiting the positive feedback loop that results in neuronal propagation of high frequency action potentials.5,8,9

Meperidine has more affinity for the kappa-receptor than morphine. Opiate receptors are coupled with G-protein receptors and function as both positive and negative regulators of synaptic transmission via G-proteins that activate effector proteins. Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon. Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist) and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP3 and OP1 receptor agonist). This results in hyperpolarization and reduced neuronal excitability.

Progesterone receptor (PR) is a member of the nuclear/steroid hormone receptor (SHR) family of ligand-dependent transcription factors that is expressed primarily in female reproductive tissue as well as the central nervous system. As a result of its binding its associated steroid hormone, progesterone, the progesterone receptor (PR) modulates the expression of genes that regulate the development, differentiation, and proliferation of target tissues 14. In humans, PR is found to be highly expressed in the stromal (connective tissue) cells during the secretory phase and during pregnancy 10. 
Progesterone may prevent pregnancy by changing the consistency of cervical mucus to be unfavorable for sperm penetration, and by inhibiting follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which normally causes ovulation. With perfect use, the first-year failure rate for progestin-only oral contraceptives is approximately 0.5%. The typical failure rate, however, is estimated to be approximately 5%, due to late or missed pills 22.

Sulfinpyrazone competitively inhibits the reabsorption of uric acid at the proximal convoluted tubule, thereby facilitating urinary excretion of uric acid and decreasing plasma urate concentrations. This is likely done through inhibition of the urate anion transporter (hURAT1) as well as the human organic anion transporter 4 (hOAT4). Sulfinpyrazone is not intended for the treatment of acute attacks because it lacks therapeutically useful analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. Sulfinpyrazone and its sulfide metabolite possess COX inhibitory effects. Sulfinpyrazone has also been shown to be a UDP-glucuronsyltransferase inhibitor and a very potent CYP2C9 inhibitor. Sulfinpyrazone is also known to be a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) inhibitor as well as an inhibitor of several multridrug resistance proteins (MRPs).

Avatrombopag is a thrombopoietin receptor (TPOR; MPL) agonist, with possible megakaryopoiesis stimulating activity. After administration, avatrombopag binds to and stimulates the platelet thrombopoeitin receptor (TPOR), which can lead to the proliferation and differentiation of megakaryocytes from bone marrow progenitor cells. This process increases the production of platelets and may serve to prevent chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT). TPOR is classified as a cytokine receptor and as a member of the hematopoietin receptor superfamily 12.

An older school of thought is the unitary theory of general anesthetic action, suggesting that desflurane affects the lipid bilayer of cells.5,7 Studies of other halogenated inhalational anesthetics have shown that the lipid bilayer spreads out more thinly as the anesthetic incorporates into the bilayer.6 However, the anesthetic does not bind to lipid heads or acyl chains of hydrocarbons in the bilayer.6 The effect of incorporating into the lipid bilayer is not well described.6,22 By incorporating into the lipid bilayer, anesthetics may introduce disorder in the lipids, leading to some indirect effect on ion channels.7 However, this theory remains controversial.8

The CDK4/6 kinase is involved, with coregulatory partner cyclin D, in the G1-S transition. Hence, inhibition of this step prevents cell cycle progression in cells in whose this pathway is functioning. This step includes the pathways of the phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein and the E2F family of transcription factors.4

The gastroprokinetic properties of domperidone are related to its peripheral dopamine receptor blocking properties. Domperidone facilitates gastric emptying and decreases small bowel transit time by increasing esophageal and gastric peristalsis and by lowering esophageal sphincter pressure. Antiemetic: The antiemetic properties of domperidone are related to its dopamine receptor blocking activity at both the chemoreceptor trigger zone and at the gastric level. It has strong affinities for the D2 and D3 dopamine receptors, which are found in the chemoreceptor trigger zone, located just outside the blood brain barrier, which - among others - regulates nausea and vomiting

The effects as they relate to various body systems are described as follows:
General and cellular actions
Caffeine exerts several actions on cells, but the clinical relevance is poorly understood. One probable mechanism is the inhibition of nucleotide phosphodiesterase enzymes, adenosine receptors, regulation of calcium handling in cells, and participates in adenosine receptor antagonism.8,18 Phosphodiesterase enzymes regulate cell function via actions on second messengers cAMP and cGMP.9 This causes lipolysis through activation of hormone-sensitive lipases, releasing fatty acids and glycerol.14
Respiratory
The exact mechanism of action of caffeine in treating apnea related to prematurity is unknown, however, there are several proposed mechanisms, including respiratory center stimulation in the central nervous system, a reduced threshold to hypercapnia with increased response, and increased consumption of oxygen, among others.16 The blocking of the adenosine receptors enhances respiratory drive via an increase in brain medullary response to carbon dioxide, stimulating ventilation and respiratory drive, while increasing contractility of the diaphragm.12
Central nervous system
Caffeine demonstrates antagonism of all 4 adenosine receptor subtypes (A1, A2a, A2b, A3) in the central nervous system.12,16 Caffeine's effects on alertness and combatting drowsiness are specifically related to the antagonism of the A2a receptor.12
Renal system
Caffeine has diuretic effects due to is stimulatory effects on renal blood flow, increase in glomerular filtration, and increase in sodium excretion.12
Cardiovascular system
Adenosine receptor antagonism at the A1 receptor by caffeine stimulates inotropic effects in the heart. Blocking of adenosine receptors promotes catecholamine release, leading to stimulatory effects occurring in the heart and the rest of the body. In the blood vessels, caffeine exerts direct antagonism of adenosine receptors, causing vasodilation. It stimulates the endothelial cells in the blood vessel wall to release nitric oxide, potentiating blood vessel relaxation. Catecholamine release, however, antagonizes this and exerts inotropic and chronotropic effects on the heart, ultimately leading to vasoconstriction. Finally, caffeine is shown to raise systolic blood pressure measurements by 5 to 10 mmHg when it is not taken regularly, versus no effect in those who consume it regularly.12 The vasoconstricting effects of caffeine are beneficial in migraines and other types of headache, which are normally caused by vasodilation in the brain.6,21

The mechanism of this action is unclear. Possibilities include serving as an agonist of a nerve growth factor-activated protein kinase (N-Kinase), conversion to cyclic nucleotides that enable advancing nerve endings to overcome the inhibitory effects of myelin, stimulation of differentiation in rat sympathetic neurons, augmentation of nerve growth factor-induced neuritogenesis and promotion of the survival of astrocytes, among others. The mechanism of inosine's possible cardioprotective effect is similarly unclear. Inosine has been reported to have a positive inotropic effect and also to have mild coronary vasodilation activity. Exogenous inosine may contribute to the high-energy phosphate pool of cardiac muscle cells and favorably affect bioenergetics generally. Inosine has also been reported to enhance the myocardial uptake of carbohydrates relative to free fatty acids as well as glycolysis. In cell culture studies, inosine has been found to inhibit the production, in immunostimulated macrophages and spleen cells, of the proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1, interleukin (IL)-12, macrophage-inflammatory protein-1 alpha and interferon (IFN)-gamma. It also suppressed proinflammatory cytokine production and mortality in a mouse endotoxemic model. These actions might account for the possible immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and anti-ischemic actions of inosine.

Such H1 receptors are located on respiratory smooth muscles, vascular endothelial cells, the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), cardiac tissue, immune cells, the uterus, and the central nervous system (CNS) neurons 9,10,11,17,5. When the H1 receptor is stimulated in these tissues it produces a variety of actions including increased vascular permeability, promotion of vasodilation causing flushing, decreased atrioventricular (AV) node conduction time, stimulation of sensory nerves of airways producing coughing, smooth muscle contraction of bronchi and the GIT, and eosinophilic chemotaxis that promotes the allergic immune response 9,10,11,17,5.
Ultimately, diphenhydramine functions as an inverse agonist at H1 receptors, and subsequently reverses effects of histamine on capillaries, reducing allergic reaction symptoms 9,10,11,17,5. Moreover, since diphenhydramine is a first-generation antihistamine, it readily crosses the blood-brain barrier and inversely agonizes the H1 CNS receptors, resulting in drowsiness, and suppressing the medullary cough center 9,10,11,17,5.
Furthermore, H1 receptors are similar to muscarinic receptors 9,10,11,17,5. Consequently, diphenhydramine also acts as an antimuscarinic 9,10,11,17,5. It does so by behaving as a competitive antagonist of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, resulting in its use as an antiparkinson medication 9,10,11,17,5.
Lastly, diphenhydramine has also demonstrated activity as an intracellular sodium channel blocker, resulting in possible local anesthetic properties 9.

Though its primary mode of action is thought to be via H1-receptor antagonism, azelastine (like other second-generation antihistamines) appears to affect other mediators of allergic symptomatology. Azelastine has mast cell-stabilizing properties that prevent the release of interleukin-6, tryptase, histamine, and TNF-alpha2 from mast cells, and has been shown to reduce mediators of mast cell degranulation such as leukotrienes in the nasal lavage of patients with rhinitis,1 as well as inhibiting their production and release from eosinophils (potentially via inhibition of phospholipase A2 and leukotriene C4 synthase).2,9 Additionally, patients using oral azelastine were observed to have significantly reduced concentrations of substance P and bradykinin in nasal secretions2, both of which may play a role in nasal itching and sneezing in patients with allergic rhinitis.

Male hypogonadism, resulting from insufficient testosterone secretion, has two main etiologies: primary hypogonadism is caused by defects in the gonads, whereas secondary hypogonadism is the failure of the hypothalamus (or pituitary) to produce sufficient gonadotropins (FSH and LH).6
In the circulation, testosterone undecanoate is cleaved by endogenous non-specific esterases to release testosterone, the active component of the compound. The undecanoate side chain is pharmacologically inactive.1,6 Testosterone can be further converted by 5a reductase to its more biologically active form, dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The actions of testosterone and DHT are mediated via androgen receptor, which is widely expressed in many tissues, including the bone, muscle, prostate, and adipose tissue. Testosterone binds to androgen receptors with high affinity and regulates target gene transcription involved in the normal growth and development of the male sex organs and the maintenance of secondary sex characteristics.4 Testosterone can cause improved sexual function, increased lean body mass, bone density, erythropoiesis, prostate size, and changes in lipid profiles.3

This complex subsequently inhibits calcineurin, which in turn stops the dephosphorylation as well as the activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) that normally cause inflammatory reactions. NF-AT is a transcription factor that promotes the production of cytokines such as IL-2, IL-4, interferon-gamma and TNF-alpha, all of which are involved in the inflammatory process. Specifically, the inhibition of IL-2, which is necessary for T cell activation or proliferation, is believed to be responsible for cyclosporine's immunosuppressive actions.2,11 In addition to the above, the inhibition of NF-AT leads to lower levels of other factors associated with T helper cell function and thymocyte development.2

Other organs that may be affected by cystinosis include the CNS, thyroid, pancreas, muscle tissues, and gonads.2
Cysteamine converts cystine to cysteine and cysteine-cysteamine mixed disulfides, reducing the buildup of corneal cystine crystals.11 This drug participates in a thiol-disulfide interchange reaction with lysosomes, leading to cysteine exit from the lysosome in patients diagnosed with cystinosis.12

These thyroglobulin molecules then degrade within thyroid follicular cells to form either thyroxine (T4) or tri-iodothyronine (T3), which are the main hormones produced by the thyroid gland.13
Methimazole may directly inhibit TPO, but has been shown in vivo to instead act as a competitive substrate for TPO, thus becoming iodinated itself and interfering with the iodination of thyroglobulin.6 Another proposed theory is that methimazole’s sulfur moiety may interact directly with the iron atom at the centre of TPO’s heme molecule, thus inhibiting its ability to iodinate tyrosine residues.12 Other proposed mechanisms with weaker evidence include methimazole binding directly to thyroglobulin or direct inhibition of thyroglobulin itself.6

With usual doses, these contractions precede periods of relaxation; with larger doses, basal uterine tone is elevated and these relaxation periods will be decreased. Contraction of the uterine wall around bleeding vessels at the placental site produces hemostasis. Ergonovine also induces cervical contractions. The sensitivity of the uterus to the oxytocic effect is much greater toward the end of pregnancy. The oxytocic actions of ergonovine are greater than its vascular effects. Ergonovine, like other ergot alkaloids, produces arterial vasoconstriction by stimulation of alpha-adrenergic and serotonin receptors and inhibition of endothelial-derived relaxation factor release. It is a less potent vasoconstrictor than ergotamine. As a diagnostic aid (coronary vasospasm), ergonovine causes vasoconstriction of coronary arteries.

There is some evidence that gabapentin also acts on adenosine receptors15,12 and voltage-gated potassium channels,13 though the clinical relevance of its action at these sites is unclear.

Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the human cortex 11. GABAergic neurons are involved in myorelaxation, anxiolytic treatment, sedation, and anesthetics. GABA can also modulate heart rate and blood pressure.
It also has an affinity for the inhibitory glycine receptors (i.e., have glycomimetic and GABA mimetic activity), therefore acts as a muscle relaxant. Glycine is an inhibitory neurotransmitter and acts as an allosteric regulator of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors. It is involved in the processing of motor and sensory data, thereby regulating movement, vision, and audition.

In one study, thiocolchicoside inhibited the function of recombinant human strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors composed of the alpha1 subunit with a potency (median inhibitory concentration of 47 microM) lower than that apparent with recombinant GABA(A) receptors. The drug also inhibited the function of human nicotinic acetylcholine receptors made of the alpha4 and beta2 subunits, however, this effect was partial and moreover only apparent at high concentrations. Thiocolchicoside demonstrated no effect on the function of 5-HT(3A) serotonin receptors 11.

Ras as well as several kinases and phosphatases are responsible for regulating the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway.7 Often in cancers, Ras (a G-protein coupled receptor) is deregulated, allowing downstream signalling to proceed unchecked.7 Through several complex steps, Raf phosphorylates and activates MEK, which then phosphorylates and activates ERK.4,7 ERK is then able to exert its effects on several downstream targets.4,7
As such, therapies inhibiting upstream components of this pathway have become attractive targets for cancer treatment.4 Selumetinib exerts its effects by selectively inhibiting MEK1 and MEK2 which can effectively blunt the pleiotropic effects of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK cascade.3,9 By inhibiting this oncogenic pathway, selumetinib reduces cell proliferation, and promotes pro-apoptotic signal transduction.4,4,10

The above inflammatory mediators have been implicated in various psoriatic conditions as well as Behcet's disease, leading to their undesirable inflammatory symptoms such as mouth ulcers, skin lesions, and arthritis.6,13,14 Apremilast administration leads to a cascade which eventually decreases the levels of the above mediators, relieving inflammatory symptoms.

In the case of acetaminophen overdoses, a portion of the drug is metabolized by CYP2E1 to form the potentially toxic metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI).16 The amount of NAPQI produced in an overdose saturates and depletes glutathione stores.16 The free NAPQI promiscuously binds to proteins in hepatocytes, leading to cellular necrosis.16 Acetylcysteine can directly conjugate NAPQI or provide cysteine for glutathione production and NAPQI conjugation.16

When NO binds to sGC, the enzyme catalyzes synthesis of the signaling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). Intracellular cGMP plays an important role in regulating processes that influence vascular tone, proliferation, fibrosis and inflammation. Pulmonary hypertension is associated with endothelial dysfunction, impaired synthesis of nitric oxide and insufficient stimulation of the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway. 
Riociguat has a dual mode of action. It sensitizes sGC to endogenous NO by stabilizing the NO-sGC binding. Riociguat also directly stimulates sGC via a different binding site, independently of NO. Riociguat stimulates the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway and leads to increased generation of cGMP with subsequent vasodilation.

Somatic ACE has two functionally active domains, N and C, which arise from tandem gene duplication. Although the two domains have high sequence similarity, they play distinct physiological roles. The C-domain is predominantly involved in blood pressure regulation while the N-domain plays a role in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and proliferation. ACE inhibitors bind to and inhibit the activity of both domains, but have much greater affinity for and inhibitory activity against the C-domain. Captopril, one of the few ACE inhibitors that is not a prodrug, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII. Decreasing ATII levels in the body decreases blood pressure by inhibiting the pressor effects of ATII as described in the Pharmacology section above. Captopril also causes an increase in plasma renin activity likely due to a loss of feedback inhibition mediated by ATII on the release of renin and/or stimulation of reflex mechanisms via baroreceptors. Captopril’s affinity for ACE is approximately 30,000 times greater than that of ATI.

Tetrahydrobiopterin is also a natural co-factor for nitrate oxide synthase. Therefore BH4 is required for the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine, for the production of epinephrine (adrenaline) and the synthesis of the monoamine neuro-transmitters, serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). It is also involved in apoptosis and other cellular events mediated by nitric oxide production. As a coenzyme, BH4 reacts with molecular oxygen to form an active oxygen intermediate that can hydroxylate substrates. In the hydroxylation process, the co-enzyme loses two electrons and is regenerated in vivo in an NADH-dependent reaction. As a co-factor for PAH, tetrahydrobiopterin allows the conversion of phenylalanine to tyrosine and reduces the level of phenylalanine in the bloodstream, thereby reducing the toxic effects of of this amino acid. Normal serum concentrations of phenylalanine are 100 micomolar, while elevated (toxic) levels are typically >1200 micromolar. Individuals with a deficiency in tetrahydrobiopterin are not able to efficiently convert phenylalanine to tyrosine. The excess levels provided by tetrahydrobiopterin supplementation help improve enzyme efficiency. As a co-factor for tyrosine hydroxylase, BH4 facilitates the conversion of tyrosine to L-dopa while as a co-factor for tryptophan hydroxylase, BH4 allows the conversion of tryptophan to 5-hydroxytryptophan, which is then converted to serotonin.

It is thought that metabolism of high doses of acetaminophen in the liver lead to decreased levels of hepatic glutathione and increased oxidative stress. L-methionine is a precursor to L-cysteine. L-cysteine itself may have antioxidant activity. L-cysteine is also a precursor to the antioxidant glutathione. Antioxidant activity of L-methionine and metabolites of L-methionine appear to account for its possible anti-hepatotoxic activity. Recent research suggests that methionine itself has free-radical scavenging activity by virtue of its sulfur, as well as its chelating ability.

In the treatment of head lice dimethicone 100, the respiratory systems of head lice are targeted. NYDA works by suffocating the lice, nymphs and the embryos. The physical properties of this drug, including the viscosity and spreading property of the solution allow it to easily flow into the respiratory system of all developmental stages of the insect, causing suffocation and death of the organisms. It diffuses through the stigmata (spiracles) of the lice, into the tracheae of the head lice as well as through the aeropyles of the egg operculum. The solution then displaces oxygen. The low viscosity, volatile dimethicone enables the NYDA head lice solution to penetrate into the breathing system. Its evaporation causes the thickening of the NYDA solution. The remaining high viscosity dimethicone ultimately encloses the respiratory system and thus leading to suffocation of all stages of head lice (adult lice, larvae and eggs). This mode of action prevents the development of lice resistance by preventing the formation of new progency 9.
Studies performed using house crickets and lice suggest a close correlation between the death of the lice and the influx of the solution into the insect head tracheae. These data strongly suggest that the total filling of the head tracheae immediately blocks the oxygen supply to the insect central nervous system. Death, following numerous stages of disability after the entrance of dimethicones into the abdominal tracheal system, demonstrates the sequence of oxygen deprivation. NYDA was applied directly to the head and mouth of the organism, and was found to have no effect when applied solely to the outside of the head/mouth 9."

The drug exerts a potent cytotoxic effect against CD22+ B-cell lymphoma when the antibody binds to the CD22 receptor on the surface of B cells . The drug-CD22 complex is rapidly internalized into the cell, forming an endosome which subsequently fuses with lysosomes. N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide is then intracellularly released into the acidic environment. N-acetyl-gamma-calicheamicin dimethylhydrazide is a calicheamicin derivative, which is naturally produced by the bacterium Micromonospora echinospora, and is toxic to the body when not bound to the antibody. It mediates apoptosis of the cell by binding to the minor groove of DNA in a sequence-specific manner and undergoing a structural change to generate diradicals 6.

However, this activated glycosylated phosphoprotein is not expressed on haematopoietic stem cells, pro-B cells (precursors), or differentiated plasma cells 3,4.

Upon cell surface binding to CD20-expressing B lymphocytes, ocrelizumab promotes antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-mediated cell lysis. The capacity for B-cell reconstitution and preexisting humoral immunity is preserved 4, such as levels of IgG and IgM antibodies in the blood of cerebrospinal fluid. Ocrelizumab may induce antibody-dependant cellular cytotoxicity involving macrophages, natural killer cells, and cytotoxic T cells that act together to cause cell death 3. Another mechanism is apoptosis, which may result from cross-linking membrane CD20 on the target cell surface 3.

It blocks bacterial adherence to cells, preventing pulmonary infections.2 Glycoproteins (fucomucins, sialomucins and sulfomucins) regulate the viscoelastic properties of bronchial mucus. Increased fucomucins can be found in the mucus of patients with COPD. Carbocisteine serves to restore equilibrium between sialomucins and fucomucins, likely by intracellular stimulation of sialyl transferase enzyme, thus reducing mucus viscosity.2
A study found that L-carbocisteine can inhibit damage to cells by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by activating protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation, suggesting that carbocisteine may have antioxidant effects and prevent apoptosis of lung cells.5 There is some evidence that carbocisteine suppresses NF-<U+03BA>B and ERK1/2 MAPK signalling pathways, reducing TNF-alpha induced inflammation in the lungs, as well as other inflammatory pathways.8,9 An in-vitro study found that L-carbocisteine reduces intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), inhibiting rhinovirus 14 infection, thereby reducing airway inflammation.10

On a molecular level, colchicine can be described as an anti-mitotic drug, blocking the mitotic activity cells in the metaphase part of the cell cycle. Specifically, colchicine binds to tubulin, forming complexes that bind to microtubules. This stops their elongation. At low concentrations, colchicine stops microtubule growth and, at elevated concentrations, colchicine causes the depolymerization of microtubules.2

The ability of AMN107 to inhibit TEL-platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (TEL-PDGFRbeta), which causes chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia, and FIP1-like-1-PDGFRalpha, which causes hypereosinophilic syndrome, suggests potential use of AMN107 for myeloproliferative diseases characterised by these kinase fusions (Stover et al, 2005; Weisberg et al, 2005). AMN107 also inhibits the c-Kit receptor kinase, including the D816V-mutated variant of KIT, at pharmacologically achievable concentrations, supporting potential utility in the treatment of mastocytosis, and gastrointestinal stromal tumours (Weisberg et al, 2005; von Bubnoff et al, 2005; Gleixner et al, 2006).

In particular, benzydamine predominantly acts by inhibiting the synthesis of pro inflammatory cytokines like tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) and interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß) without largely affecting other pro inflammatory cytokines (ie. such as IL-6 and IL-8) or anti-inflammatory cytokines (ie. like IL-10 or IL-1 receptor antagonist). 3,5
Moreover, benzydamine is largely a weak inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis as it has been shown to effectively inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase enzyme activity only at concentrations of 1mM or greater. Considering most contemporary usages of benzydamine are topical applications that are generally not well absorbed through the skin and/or non-specialized mucosae, benzydamine does not often achieve the kind of absorption or blood concentrations necessary to cause any extraneous distant systemic effects or COX inhibition, allowing it to localize its action. 3,5
Additionally, it is also hypothesized that benzydamine is capable of inhibiting the oxidative burst of neutrophils and membrane stabilization. These actions are exhibited by the substance’s ability to inhibit the release of granules from neutrophils and to stabilize lysosomes. 3,5
Furthermore, benzydamine is capable of a local anaesthetic effect that may be related to its capability for inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators like substance P and calcitonin gene related peptide from sensory nerve endings. Since substance P is capable of causing the release of histamine from mast cells, benzydamine’s prevention of substance P release further contributes to an anti-inflammatory effect. 3,5
Benzydamine also demonstrates a non-specific antibacterial activity against various bacterial strains that are resistant to broad-spectrum antibiotics such as ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline at concentrations of about 3 mmol/L. Combinatorial use of benzydamine and other antibiotics like tetracycline and chloramphenicol are also synergistic against antibiotic resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 3"	"DB09084"	"132-69-4"	65464	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

Nicorandil is an activator and opener of ATP-sensitive (ATP-dependent) potassium channels (KATP channels) that are composed of Kir6.x-type subunits and sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits. Nicorandil binding sites are located in the sulfonylurea receptor 2 (SUR2) in the ATP-sensitive potassium channel 4, which are regulatory subunits of the channel that exhibit an ATPase activitiy 2. There are 2 types of SUR2 subunits (2A/2B) that have identical nucleotide binding domains (NBD), where SUR2A is more predominantly expressed in skeletal and cardiac myocytes and SUR2B in smooth muscle cells 2. Nicorandil more potently activates SUR2B/Kir6.2 than SUR2A/Kir6.2 channels to cause hyperpolarization. ATP-NBD1 interaction influences the channel signalling by nicorandil, and the response of the channel to nicorandil is also facilitated and heightened by the interaction of ATP or ADP with NBD2 3. Potentiated activity of ATP-sensitive channels have cardioprotective role by limiting the duration of action potentials and preventing intraceullar calcium overload 7. This attenuates cellular injury by preserving cellular energetics and ultimately cell survival 6. KATP channel-dependent membrane hyperpolarization can also lead to vasodilation via reduction in Ca2+ influx through the voltage-gated Ca2+ channels and regulation of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in smooth muscle cells 6.
Nicorandil contain a nitrate moiety in its structure, making it a good dilator of vascular smooth muscle like other nitroglycerin esters 5. Direct relaxation of venous vascular system arises from NO-donor mediated stimulation of guanylyl cyclase and increased levels of intracellular cyclic GMP (cGMP). Elevated levels of cGMP contributes to the total relaxing effect of nicorandil at higher concentrations of the drug 1.

Many of these RTKs are implicated in lung fibrosis and tumour angiogenesis, so nintedanib is therefore used in the treatment of proliferative diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, non-small cell lung cancer, and systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease.8,9 The specific RTKs that nintedanib inhibits are platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFR) a and ß, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1-3, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1-3, and Fns-Like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3).8,9,5 Nintedanib binds to the ATP-binding pocket of these receptors and inhibits their activity, thereby blocking signalling cascades that result in the proliferation and migration of lung fibroblasts. Nintedanib also inhibits kinase signalling pathways in various cells within tumour tissues, including endothelial cells, pericytes, smooth muscle cells, and cells contributing to angiogenesis, culminating in an inhibition of cell proliferation and apoptosis of affected tumour cells.5
In addition to RTK inhibition, nintedanib also prevents the actions of the nRTKs Lck, Lyn, and Src.8,9,5 The contribution of the inhibition of Lck and Lyn towards the therapeutic efficacy of nintedanib is unclear, but inhibition of the Src pathway by nintedanib has been shown to reduce lung fibrosis.5,7

Metformin decreases blood glucose levels by decreasing hepatic glucose production (also called gluconeogenesis), decreasing the intestinal absorption of glucose, and increasing insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization.23 It is well established that metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I activity, and it has since been generally postulated that its potent antidiabetic effects occur through this mechanism.6,11 The above processes lead to a decrease in blood glucose, managing type II diabetes and exerting positive effects on glycemic control.
After ingestion, the organic cation transporter-1 (OCT1) is responsible for the uptake of metformin into hepatocytes (liver cells). As this drug is positively charged, it accumulates in cells and in the mitochondria because of the membrane potentials across the plasma membrane as well as the mitochondrial inner membrane. Metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex I, preventing the production of mitochondrial ATP leading to increased cytoplasmic ADP:ATP and AMP:ATP ratios.6 These changes activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an enzyme that plays an important role in the regulation of glucose metabolism.15 Aside from this mechanism, AMPK can be activated by a lysosomal mechanism involving other activators. Following this process, increases in AMP:ATP ratio also inhibit fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase enzyme, resulting in the inhibition of gluconeogenesis, while also inhibiting adenylate cyclase and decreasing the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP),6 a derivative of ATP used for cell signaling 16. Activated AMPK phosphorylates two isoforms of acetyl-CoA carboxylase enzyme, thereby inhibiting fat synthesis and leading to fat oxidation, reducing hepatic lipid stores and increasing liver sensitivity to insulin.6
In the intestines, metformin increases anaerobic glucose metabolism in enterocytes (intestinal cells), leading to reduced net glucose uptake and increased delivery of lactate to the liver. Recent studies have also implicated the gut as a primary site of action of metformin and suggest that the liver may not be as important for metformin action in patients with type 2 diabetes. Some of the ways metformin may play a role on the intestines is by promoting the metabolism of glucose by increasing glucagon-like peptide I (GLP-1) as well as increasing gut utilization of glucose.6
In addition to the above pathway, the mechanism of action of metformin may be explained by other ways, and its exact mechanism of action has been under extensive study in recent years.7,9,10,11

This process leads to the inhibition of histamine binding to this receptor, causing the reduction of gastric acid secretion. The relief of gastric-acid related symptoms can occur as soon as 60 minutes after administration of a single dose, and the effects can last from 4-10 hours, providing fast and effective symptomatic relief.3,9,11

Bisoprolol is a competitive, cardioselective ß1-adrenergic antagonist. When ß1-receptors (located mainly in the heart)14 are activated by adrenergic neurotransmitters such as epinephrine, both the blood pressure and heart rate increase, leading to greater cardiovascular work, increasing the demand for oxygen. Bisoprolol reduces cardiac workload by decreasing contractility and the need for oxygen through competitive inhibition of ß1-adrenergic receptors.7,14
Bisoprolol is also thought to reduce the output of renin in the kidneys, which normally increases blood pressure. Additionally, some central nervous system effects of bisoprolol may include diminishing sympathetic nervous system output from the brain, decreasing blood pressure and heart rate.16

During such contraction processes, ATP molecules are depleted as they undergo hydrolysis reactions and become adenosine diphosphate (ADP). To maintain homeostasis in muscle activity, the ATP supply of muscles must be regenerated regularly.
Phosphocreatine occurs naturally within the body and is capable of regenerating ATP by transferring a high-energy phosphate from itself to ADP, resulting in the formation of ATP and creatine. This kind of regeneration of ATP with phosphocreatine typically occurs within seconds of intense muscular or neuronal effort, acting as a quickly accessible reserve of high-energy phosphates for the recycling of ATP in body muscle tissues. ATP recycling from phosphocreatine is in fact known as the quickest form of ATP regeneration.

Some reports have indicated that fluocinolone acetonide presents a high binding affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor. After binding the receptor, the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements in the promoter region of the target genes.6 This effect promotes the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins (lipocortins). Through this mechanism of action, it is thought that fluocinolone induces mainly one of the lipocortins, annexin 1, which will later mediate the synthesis of inflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of arachidonic acid which is the precursor of all these inflammatory mediators. Hence, the induction of these proteins will prevent the release of arachidonic acid by phospholipase A2.19

This stimulates intestinal calcium absorption and increases renal phosphate excretion. These are functions that are normally carried out by the parathyroid hormone.

Conversely, vitamin D deficiency can often occur from a combination of insufficient exposure to sunlight, inadequate dietary intake of vitamin D, genetic defects with endogenous vitamin D receptor, or even severe liver or kidney disease 1. Such deficiency is known for resulting in conditions like rickets or osteomalacia, all of which reflect inadequate mineralization of bone, enhanced compensatory skeletal demineralization, resultant decreased calcium ion blood concentrations, and increases in the production and secretion of parathyroid hormone 4. Increases in parathyroid hormone stimulate the mobilization of skeletal calcium and the renal excretion of phosphorus 4. This enhanced mobilization of skeletal calcium leads towards porotic bone conditions 4.
Ordinarily, while vitamin D3 is made naturally via photochemical processes in the skin, both itself and vitamin D2 can be found in various food and pharmaceutical sources as dietary supplements. The principal biological function of vitamin D is the maintenance of normal levels of serum calcium and phosphorus in the bloodstream by enhancing the efficacy of the small intestine to absorb these minerals from the diet 4. At the liver, vitamin D3 or D2 is hydroxylated to 25-hydroxyvitamin D and then finally to the primary active metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D in the kidney via further hydroxylation 4,1. This final metabolite binds to endogenous vitamin d receptors, which results in a variety of regulatory roles - including maintaining calcium balance, the regulation of parathyroid hormone, the promotion of the renal reabsorption of calcium, increased intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphorus, and increased calcium and phosphorus mobilization of calcium and phosphorus from bone to plasma to maintain balanced levels of each in bone and the plasma 4,1.
In particular, calcitriol interacts with vitamin D receptors in the small intestine to enhance the efficiency of intestinal calcium and phosphorous absorption from about 10-15% to 30-40% and 60% increased to 80%, respectively 9. Furthermore, calcitriol binds with vitamin D receptors in osteoblasts to stimulate a receptor activator of nuclear factor kB ligand (or RANKL) which subsequently interacts with receptor activator of nuclear factor kB (NFkB) on immature preosteoclasts, causing them to become mature bone-resorbing osteoclasts 9. Such mature osteoclasts ultimately function in removing calcium and phosphorus from bone to maintain blood calcium and phosphorus levels 9. Moreover, calcitriol also stimulates calcium reabsorption from the glomerular filtrate in the kidneys 9.
Additionally, it is believed that when calcitriol binds with nuclear vitamin D receptors, that this bound complex itself binds to retinoic acid X receptor (RXR) to generate a heterodimeric complex that consequently binds to specific nucleotide sequences in the DNA called vitamin D response elements 9. When bound, various transcription factors attach to this complex, resulting in either up or down-regulation of the associated gene's activity. It is thought that there may be as much as 200 to 2000 genes that possess vitamin D response elements or that are influenced indirectly to control a multitude of genes across the genome 9. It is in this way that cholecalciferol is believed to function in regulating gene transcription associated with cancer risk, autoimmune disorders, and cardiovascular disease linked to vitamin D deficiency 9. In fact, there has been some research to suggest calcitriol may also be able to prevent malignancies by inducing cellular maturation and inducing apoptosis and inhibiting angiogenesis, exhibit anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting foam cell formation and promoting angiogenesis in endothelial colony-forming cells in vitro, inhibit immune reactions by enhancing the transcription of endogenous antibiotics like cathelicidin and regulate the activity and differentiation of CD4+ T cells, amongst a variety of other proposed actions 9.

However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor, arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. Alclometasone initially binds the corticosteroid receptor. This complex migrates to the nucleus where it binds to different glucocorticoid response elements on the DNA. This in turn enhances and represses various genes, especially those involved in inflammatory pathways.

Numerous studies demonstrate that the depletion of B-cells can significantly alleviate symptoms of many forms of leukemia and lymphoma, which are malignancies associated with B-cell dysfunctions and high expression of CD20.4
Ofatumumab is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that binds to the small and large extracellular loops of the CD20 molecule. The Fab domain of ofatumumab binds to CD20, and this drug-target interaction does not result in immediate shedding and internalization of CD20 from the plasma membrane of B lymphocytes.2,6 This allows ofatumumab to persist on the B lymphocyte cell surface for an extended period and recruit immunological molecules or FcR-expressing innate effectors, such as macrophages, that mediate immune effector functions with strong cytotoxic effects.2,4 These immune effector functions include complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CCD) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), which promote the lysis of malignant B-cells.2,4,6 Complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) involves translocation of the CD20 molecule into lipid rafts, which are involved in cell signalling and receptor trafficking.1
The mechanism by which ofatumumab exerts a therapeutic effect in multiple sclerosis patients is unknown but is presumed to still occur as a consequence of its ability to bind CD20.9

Methionine synthase is essential for the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines that form DNA. L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase converts L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA in the degradation of propionate 24, an important reaction required for both fat and protein metabolism. It is a lack of vitamin B12 cofactor in the above reaction and the resulting accumulation of methylmalonyl CoA that is believed to be responsible for the neurological manifestations of B12 deficiency 10. Succinyl-CoA is also necessary for the synthesis of hemoglobin 24. 
In tissues, vitamin B12 is required for the synthesis of methionine from homocysteine. Methionine is required for the formation of S-adenosylmethionine, a methyl donor for nearly 100 substrates, comprised of DNA, RNA, hormones, proteins, as well as lipids 24. Without vitamin B12, tetrahydrofolate cannot be regenerated from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, and this can lead to functional folate deficiency 22, Label.
This reaction is dependent on methylcobalamin (vitamin B12) as a co-factor and is also dependent on folate, in which the methyl group of methyltetrahydrofolate is transferred to homocysteine to form methionine and tetrahydrofolate. Vitamin B12 incorporates into circulating folic acid into growing red blood cells; retaining the folate in these cells 23. A deficiency of vitamin B12 and the interruption of this reaction leads to the development of megaloblastic anemia.

By blocking viral entry into CD4 cells, ibalizumab creates a barrier for HIV, which is a different mechanism from those of entry inhibitors that target viral proteins or chemokine co-receptors.
Ibalizumab is a CD4 domain 2-directed post-attachment HIV-1 inhibitor. This binding specificity of ibalizumab-uiyk to domain 2 of CD4 allows ibalizumab-uiyk to prevent viral entry into host cells without causing immunosuppression. Epitope mapping studies confirm that ibalizumab-uiyk binds to a conformational epitope located mainly in domain 2 of the extracellular region of the CD4 receptor. This epitope is located on the surface of CD4 opposite to the site in domain 1 that is essential for CD4 binding of the MHC class II molecules. This drug, therefore, does not interfere with CD4 cell-mediated immune functions. In addition, ibalizumab-uiyk does not interfere with gp120 attachment to CD4 Label. Ibalizumab’s post-binding conformational effects block the gp120-CD4 complex from interacting with CCR5 or CXCR4 and thus prevents viral entry and fusion 6.
CD4 is an integral cell surface glycoprotein that is able to enhance T cell-specific antigen responses when it interacts with its physiological ligand, class II major histocompatibility (MHC) molecules. In addition, CD4 is a specific cell-surface receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). 
The entry of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) into cells requires the sequential binding of the viral exterior envelope glycoprotein, gp120, with the CD4 glycoprotein and a chemokine receptor on the cell surface. In addition, the CD4/gp120 interaction may directly inhibit T cell function 3.
In addition to the above mechanism of action, it was found in one study that ibalizumab-uiyk inhibits the replication of CCR5- and CXCR4- receptor laboratory strains and primary isolates of HIV-1 in phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes, further confirming its action 9.

Although sulbactam alone possesses little useful antibacterial activity, except against the Neisseriaceae, whole organism studies have shown that sulbactam restores ampicillin activity against beta-lactamase producing strains. In particular, sulbactam has good inhibitory activity against the clinically important plasmid mediated beta-lactamases most frequently responsible for transferred drug resistance. The presence of sulbactam in formulations with ampicillin effectively extends the antibacterial spectrum of ampicillin to include many bacteria normally resistant to it and to other beta-lactam antibacterials. Thus, products with ampicillin + sulbactam possess the properties of a broad-spectrum antibacterial and a beta-lactamase inhibitor.

Anagrelide is a known inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 3A (PDE3A), although its platelet-lowering effects appear unrelated to this inhibition.6 While PDE3 inhibitors, as a class, can inhibit platelet aggregation, this effect is only seen at higher anagrelide doses (i.e. greater than those required to reduce platelet count).9 Modulation of PDE3A has been implicated in causing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells expressing both PDE3A and SLFN12,4 and may be of value in the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumours.5

This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects of methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects.

It is possible that modafinil acts by a synergistic combination of mechanisms including direct inhibition of dopamine reuptake, indirect inhibition of noradrenalin reuptake in the VLPO and orexin activation. Modafinil has partial alpha 1B-adrenergic agonist effects by directly stimulating the receptors.

The mechanism of action against Fasciola species is not fully understood at this time. In vitro studies and animal studies suggest that triclabendazole and its active metabolites (sulfoxide and sulfone) are absorbed by the outer body covering of the immature and mature worms, causing a reduction in the resting membrane potential, the inhibition of tubulin function as well as protein and enzyme synthesis necessary for survival. These metabolic disturbances lead to an inhibition of motility, disruption of the worm outer surface, in addition to the inhibition of spermatogenesis and egg/embryonic cells.Label
A note on resistance
In vitro studies, in vivo studies, as well as case reports suggest a possibility for the development of resistance to triclabendazole.
The mechanism of resistance may be multifactorial and include changes in drug uptake/efflux mechanisms, target molecules, and changes in drug metabolism. The clinical significance of triclabendazole resistance in humans is not yet elucidated.Label

As a result, cerebral edema, elevated intracranial pressure, and cerebrospinal fluid volume and pressure may be reduced. As a diurectic mannitol induces diuresis because it is not reabsorbed in the renal tubule, thereby increasing the osmolality of the glomerular filtrate, facilitating excretion of water, and inhibiting the renal tubular reabsorption of sodium, chloride, and other solutes. Mannitol promotes the urinary excretion of toxic materials and protects against nephrotoxicity by preventing the concentration of toxic substances in the tubular fluid. As an Antiglaucoma agent mannitol levates blood plasma osmolarity, resulting in enhanced flow of water from the eye into plasma and a consequent reduction in intraocular pressure. As a renal function diagnostic aid mannitol is freely filtered by the glomeruli with less than 10% tubular reabsorption. Therefore, its urinary excretion rate may serve as a measurement of glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
The exact mechanism of action of inhaled mannitol in the symptomatic maintenance treatment of cystic fibrosis remains unclear.7,8 It is hypothesized that mannitol produces an osmotic gradient across the airway epithelium that draws fluid into the extracellular space and alters the properties of the airway surface mucus layer, allowing easier mucociliary clearance.7"	"DB00742"	"133-43-7"	6251	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA

Salicylic acid allows cells of the epidermis to more readily slough off. Because of its effect on skin cells, salicylic acid is used in several shampoos used to treat dandruff. Salicylic acid is also used as an active ingredient in gels which remove verrucas (plantar warts). Salicylic acid competitively inhibits oxidation of uridine-5-diphosphoglucose (UDPG) with nicotinamide adenosine dinucleotide (NAD) and noncompetitively with UDPG. It also competitively inhibits the transferring of the glucuronyl group of uridine-5-phosphoglucuronic acid (UDPGA) to a phenolic acceptor. Inhibition of mucopoly saccharide synthesis is likely responsible for the slowing of wound healing with salicylates.

These mediators are derived from arachidonic acid metabolism through the lipoxygenase and cyclo-oxygenase pathways. The mechanism of action of nedocromil may be due partly to inhibition of axon reflexes and release of sensory neuropeptides, such as substance P, neurokinin A, and calcitonin-geneñrelated peptides. The result is inhibition of bradykinin-induced bronchoconstriction. Nedocromil does not posess any bronchodilator, antihistamine, or corticosteroid activity.

Trifluridine gets incorporated into viral DNA during replication, which leads to the formation of defective proteins and an increased mutation rate. Trifluridine also mediates antineoplastic activities via this mechanism; following uptake into cancer cells, trifluridine is rapidly phosphorylated by thymidine kinase to its active monophosphate form 2. Subsequent phosphorylation produces trifluridine triphosphate 2, which is readily incorporated into the DNA of tumour cells in place of thymidine bases to perturb DNA function, DNA synthesis, and tumour cell proliferation Label. As trifluridine is subject to rapid degradation by TPase and readily metabolised by a first-pass effect following oral administration, tipiracil is added in the antineoplastic combination product as an inhibitor of TPase to increase the bioavailability of trifluridine 6. Trifluridine monophosphate also reversibly inhibits thymidylate synthetase (TS), an enzyme that is necessary for DNA synthesis and which levels are shown to be elevated different cancer cell lines 3. Up-regulation of the expression of the TS enzyme may also lead to the resistance to antineoplastic therapies, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 3. However, this inhibitory effect is not considered to be sufficient enough to fully contribute to the cytotoxicity in cancer cells 2.

It also plays a role in the hepatic biotransformation and detoxification process; it acts as a hydrophilic molecule that is added to other lipophilic toxins or wastes prior to entering biliary excretion. It participates in the detoxification of methylglyoxal, a toxic by-product of metabolism, mediated by glyoxalase enzymes. Glyoxalase I catalyzes the conversion of methylglyoxal and reduced glutathione to S-D-Lactoyl-glutathione. Glyoxalase II catalyzes the conversion of S-D-Lactoyl Glutathione to Reduced Glutathione and D-lactate. Glyoxalase I catalyzes the conversion of methylglyoxal and reduced glutathione to S-D-Lactoyl-glutathione. Glyoxalase II catalyzes the conversion of S-D-Lactoyl Glutathione to Reduced Glutathione and D-lactate. GSH is a cofactor of conjugation and reduction reactions that are catalyzed by glutathione S-transferase enzymes expressed in the cytosol, microsomes, and mitochondria. However, it is capable of participating in non-enzymatic conjugation with some chemicals, as it is hypothesized to do to a significant extent with n-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), the reactive cytochrome P450 reactive metabolite formed by toxic overdose of acetaminophen. Glutathione in this capacity binds to NAPQI as a suicide substrate and in the process detoxifies it, taking the place of cellular protein sulfhydryl groups which would otherwise be toxically adducted. The preferred medical treatment to an overdose of this nature, whose efficacy has been consistently supported in literature, is the administration (usually in atomized form) of N-acetylcysteine, which is used by cells to replace spent GSSG and allow a usable GSH pool.

Binding of the opiate stimulates the exchange of GTP for GDP on the G-protein complex. As the effector system is adenylate cyclase and cAMP located at the inner surface of the plasma membrane, opioids decrease intracellular cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase. Subsequently, the release of nociceptive neurotransmitters such as substance P, GABA, dopamine, acetylcholine and noradrenaline is inhibited. Opioids also inhibit the release of vasopressin, somatostatin, insulin and glucagon. Alfentanil's analgesic activity is, most likely, due to its conversion to morphine. Opioids close N-type voltage-operated calcium channels (OP2-receptor agonist) and open calcium-dependent inwardly rectifying potassium channels (OP3 and OP1 receptor agonist).

Vinorelbine tartrate is a vinca alkaloid in which the catharanthine component is the target of structural modification 9, 10.
This structural modification contributes to unique pharmacologic properties.The antitumor activity of vinorelbine tartrate is believed to be owed to the inhibition of mitosis at metaphase via its interaction with tubulin 5.
Vinorelbine is a mitotic spindle poison that interferes with chromosomal segregation during mitosis, also known as cell division. It pauses cells at the G2/M phases, when present at concentrations close to the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). Microtubules, which are derived from polymers of tubulin, are the main target of vinorelbine. 
The chemical modification used to produce vinorelbine allows for the opening of the eight-member catharanthine ring with the formation of both a covalent and reversible bond with tubulin 11.
The relative contribution of different microtubule-associated proteins in the production of tubulin vary between neural tissue and proliferating cells and this has important functional implications. The ability of vinorelbine to bind specifically to mitotic rather than other microtubules has been shown and may suggest that neurotoxicity is less likely to be a problem than with the molecular mechanism of action 11. 
As with other anti-microtubule agents, vinorelbine is known to contribute apoptosis in malignant cells. The exact mechanisms by which this process occurs are complex and many details are yet to be elucidated. The disarray of the microtubule structure has a number of effects, including the induction of tumor suppressor gene p53 and activation/inactivation of a number of protein kinases involved in essential signaling pathways, including p21 WAF1/CIP1 and Ras/Raf, PKC/PKA. These molecular changes lead to phosphorylation and consequently inactivation of the apoptosis inhibitor Bcl2. This, in turn, results in a decrease in the formation of heterodimers between Bcl2 and the pro-apoptotic gene BAX, stimulating the sequence of cell apoptosis 11.
Vinorelbine tartrate also possibly interferes with amino acid, cyclic AMP and glutathione metabolism, calmodulin-dependent Ca++-transport ATPase activity, cellular respiration, and nucleic acid and lipid biosynthesis 5.

Dopaminergic projection function in the nigrostriatal, mesolimbic, and mesocortical systems. Hyperactive dopamine transmission in the mesolimbic areas, or dopamine dysregulation in various major brain regions, is understood as the key driver of positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.9 Many antipsychotic agents act as D2 receptor antagonists, as with amisulpride.2 Amisulpride is a selective dopamine D2 and D3 receptor antagonist.10 It has high preferential activity towards dopamine receptors in the limbic system rather than the striatum, leading to a lower risk of extrapyramidal side effects than other atypical antipsychotic agents.4,6 At low doses, amisulpride reduces negative symptoms of schizophrenia by blocking pre-synaptic dopamine D2 and D3 receptors, increasing the levels of dopamine in the synaptic cleft and facilitating dopaminergic transmission.4 At higher doses, amisulpride blocks postsynaptic receptors, inhibiting dopaminergic hyperactivity: this explains the drug improving positive symptoms.1 Amisulpride also works as an antagonist at 5-HT7A receptors 8 and 5-HT2A receptors,4 which may be related to its antidepressant effects.5
The chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ), also commonly known as the area postrema (AP), is an important brain region located within the dorsal surface of the medulla oblongata. CTZ is involved in emesis: it contains receptors, such as dopamine receptors, that are activated in response to emetic agents in the blood and relay information to the vomiting center, which is responsible for inducing the vomiting reflex.7 Amisulpride is an antiemetic agent that works to limit signals that promote nausea and vomiting. Amisulpride binds to D2 and D3 receptors in the CTZ, leading to reduced dopaminergic signalling into the vomiting center.10

Because this arrangement of carbon atoms cannot be made by humans, these amino acids are an essential element in the diet. The catabolism of all three compounds initiates in muscle and yields NADH and FADH2 which can be utilized for ATP generation. The catabolism of all three of these amino acids uses the same enzymes in the first two steps. The first step in each case is a transamination using a single BCAA aminotransferase, with a-ketoglutarate as amine acceptor. As a result, three different a-keto acids are produced and are oxidized using a common branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase, yielding the three different CoA derivatives. Subsequently the metabolic pathways diverge, producing many intermediates. The principal product from valine is propionylCoA, the glucogenic precursor of succinyl-CoA. Isoleucine catabolism terminates with production of acetylCoA and propionylCoA; thus isoleucine is both glucogenic and ketogenic. Leucine gives rise to acetylCoA and acetoacetylCoA, and is thus classified as strictly ketogenic. There are a number of genetic diseases associated with faulty catabolism of the BCAAs. The most common defect is in the branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase. Since there is only one dehydrogenase enzyme for all three amino acids, all three a-keto acids accumulate and are excreted in the urine. The disease is known as Maple syrup urine disease because of the characteristic odor of the urine in afflicted individuals. Mental retardation in these cases is extensive. Unfortunately, since these are essential amino acids, they cannot be heavily restricted in the diet; ultimately, the life of afflicted individuals is short and development is abnormal The main neurological problems are due to poor formation of myelin in the CNS.

Estrogens diffuse into their target cells and interact with a protein receptor. Target cells include the female reproductive tract, the mammary gland, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary. Estrogens increase the hepatic synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other serum proteins and suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary. The combination of an estrogen with a progestin suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary system, decreasing the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).

It reversibly competes against nitrendipine and other DHP CCBs for DHP binding sites in vascular smooth muscle and cultured rabbit atrial cells. Calcium ions entering the cell through these channels bind to calmodulin. Calcium-bound calmodulin then binds to and activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK). Activated MLCK catalyzes the phosphorylation of the regulatory light chain subunit of myosin, a key step in muscle contraction. Signal amplification is achieved by calcium-induced calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through ryanodine receptors. Inhibition of the initial influx of calcium decreases the contractile activity of arterial smooth muscle cells and results in vasodilation. The vasodilatory effects of felodipine result in an overall decrease in blood pressure. Felodipine may be used to treat mild to moderate essential hypertension.

The number of PBPs differs between bacteria, in which some are considered essential and others redundant. In general, inhibition of one or more essential PBPs results in impaired cell wall homeostasis, loss of cell integrity, and is ultimately bactericidal.1,2,3
Ceftazidime is a semisynthetic third-generation cephalosporin with broad activity against numerous Gram-negative and some Gram-positive bacteria.12 Like other ß-lactam antibiotics, ceftazidime exhibits its bactericidal effect primarily through direct inhibition of specific PBPs in susceptible bacteria.4In vitro experiments in Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae suggest that ceftazidime primarily binds to PBP3, with weaker binding to PBP1a/1b and PBP2 as well; although binding to other PBPs, such as PBP4, is detectable, the concentrations required are much greater than those achieved clinically.4,5,6,7,8 Similarly, ceftazidime showed binding to Staphylococcus aureus PBP 1, 2, and 3 with a much lower affinity for PBP4.5 Recent data for Mycobacterium abcessus suggest that ceftazidime can inhibit PonA1, PonA2, and PbpA at intermediate concentrations.3

After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid production. The cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed, potentiating the effect. In other words, the two main products in inflammation Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils, macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding.

The goal of treatment with miglustat is to reduce the rate of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis so that the amount of glycosphingolipid substrate is reduced to a level which allows the residual activity of the deficient glucocerebrosidase enzyme to be more effective (substrate reduction therapy), reducing the accumulation of glucocerebroside in macrophages. In vitro and in vivo studies have shown that miglustat can reduce the synthesis of glucosylceramide-based glycosphingolipids. In clinical trials, miglustat improved liver and spleen volume, as well as hemoglobin concentration and platelet count. Inhibition of glycosphingolipid synthesis has also shown to reduce intracellular lipid storage, improve fluid-phase endosomal uptake and normalize lipid transport in peripheral blood B lymphocytes of NP-C patients, which results in a decrease in the potentially neurotoxic accumulation of gnagliosides GM2 and GM3, lactosylceramide and glucosylceramide, possibly preventing further neuronal damage. Other studies have also suggested that miglustat may indirectly modulate intracellular calcium homeostasis through its effects on glucosylceramide levels, and evidence has shown that an initiating factor in the pathogenesis of NP-C may be impaired calcium homeostasis related to sphingosine storage. Therefore, the effect that miglustat exerts on intracellular calcium levels may influence an important underlying pathogenic mechanism of NP-C.

The mu opioid receptors are currently being studied as effective targets for antidepressant therapies 30. It is believed that the clinical effects of tianeptine are owed to its modulation of these receptors 13. In addition to its actions on the opioid receptor, previous studies have owed its action to its effect on the serotonin receptor 15, 16, dopamine (D2/3) receptors 17, and glutamate receptors 11, 32, as discussed below:
Tianeptine has challenged the monoaminergic hypothesis of depression, as well as the widely supported monoaminergic mechanisms whereby the action of most known antidepressants have been explained 21. Specifically, this drug is thought to persistently alter glutamate receptor bursting of the hippocampal CA3 commissural associational synapse 2. Current research suggests that tianeptine produces its antidepressant effects through the modulation of glutamate receptor activity (for example, AMPA receptors and NMDA receptors) and affect the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which impacts neural plasticity 4. More recent studies by support the role of tianeptine in the modulation of glutaminergic activity in the amygdala, the emotional region of the brain associated with memories 2. 
Tianeptine reduces the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal response to stress, and thus prevents stress-related behavioral issues 4,5. In rodents, the stress of acute restraint increases extracellular levels of glutamate in the basolateral amygdala an effect that was inhibited by tianeptine 2. Interestingly, the SSRI fluoxetine increased extracellular glutamate levels in the basolateral amygdala regardless of stress conditions. These data demonstrate that the mechanism of action of tianeptine is distinct from SSRIs and support the hypothesis that the mechanism of action of tianeptine relates to alteration of glutaminergic activity in the amygdala and the hippocampus 2,1,4.
In addition to the above mechanisms, tianeptine is a unique antidepressant and anxiolytic medication that stimulates the uptake of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT), and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in brain tissue 2. 
Although the monoaminergic neurotransmitters serotonin (5-HT), noradrenaline (NA) and dopamine (DA) are proven to be related to the occurrence of depressive disorders, it is now recognized that monoamine deficits are not sufficient to explain the mechanism of action of antidepressant medications 2.

The first enzyme of the catabolic pathway is an iron porphyrin oxygenase that opens the indole ring. The latter enzyme is highly inducible, its concentration rising almost 10-fold on a diet high in tryptophan. Kynurenine is the first key branch point intermediate in the pathway. Kynurenine undergoes deamniation in a standard transamination reaction yielding kynurenic acid. Kynurenic acid and metabolites have been shown to act as antiexcitotoxics and anticonvulsives. A second side branch reaction produces anthranilic acid plus alanine. Another equivalent of alanine is produced further along the main catabolic pathway, and it is the production of these alanine residues that allows tryptophan to be classified among the glucogenic and ketogenic amino acids. The second important branch point converts kynurenine into 2-amino-3-carboxymuconic semialdehyde, which has two fates. The main flow of carbon elements from this intermediate is to glutarate. An important side reaction in liver is a transamination and several rearrangements to produce limited amounts of nicotinic acid, which leads to production of a small amount of NAD+ and NADP+.

Because this arrangement of carbon atoms cannot be made by humans, these amino acids are an essential element in the diet. The catabolism of all three compounds initiates in muscle and yields NADH and FADH2 which can be utilized for ATP generation. The catabolism of all three of these amino acids uses the same enzymes in the first two steps. The first step in each case is a transamination using a single BCAA aminotransferase, with a-ketoglutarate as amine acceptor. As a result, three different a-keto acids are produced and are oxidized using a common branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase, yielding the three different CoA derivatives. Subsequently the metabolic pathways diverge, producing many intermediates. The principal product from valine is propionylCoA, the glucogenic precursor of succinyl-CoA. Isoleucine catabolism terminates with production of acetylCoA and propionylCoA; thus isoleucine is both glucogenic and ketogenic. Leucine gives rise to acetylCoA and acetoacetylCoA, and is thus classified as strictly ketogenic. There are a number of genetic diseases associated with faulty catabolism of the BCAAs. The most common defect is in the branched-chain a-keto acid dehydrogenase. Since there is only one dehydrogenase enzyme for all three amino acids, all three a-keto acids accumulate and are excreted in the urine. The disease is known as Maple syrup urine disease because of the characteristic odor of the urine in afflicted individuals. Mental retardation in these cases is extensive. Unfortunately, since these are essential amino acids, they cannot be heavily restricted in the diet; ultimately, the life of afflicted individuals is short and development is abnormal The main neurological problems are due to poor formation of myelin in the CNS.

Omeprazole is a member of a class of antisecretory compounds, the substituted benzimidazoles, that stop gastric acid secretion by selective inhibition of the H+/K+ ATPase enzyme system. Proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole bind covalently to cysteine residues via disulfide bridges on the alpha subunit of the H+/K+ ATPase pump, inhibiting gastric acid secretion for up to 36 hours 11.

Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is frequently associated with Helicobacter pylori bacterial infection (NSAIDs) 12. The treatment of H. pylori infection may include the addition of omeprazole or other proton pump inhibitors as part of the treatment regimen Label, 13.
H. pylori replicates most effectively at a neutral pH 14. Acid inhibition in H. pylori eradication therapy, including proton-pump inhibitors such as omeprazole, raises gastric pH, discouraging the growth of H.pylori 13.

However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2.

Bempedoic acid is a prodrug that requires activation in the liver. The very-long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase-1 (ACSVL1) enzyme is responsible for its activation to ETC-1002-CoA, the pharmacologically active metabolite. ATP lyase (also known as ATP synthase) plays an important part of cholesterol synthesis. BETC-1002-CoA directly inhibits this enzyme after the parent drug is activated in the liver by coenzyme A (CoA).5,6
This inhibition leads to upregulation of the LDL cholesterol receptor, reducing serum LDL-C via increased uptake and LDL clearance in the liver. By the above mechanisms, bempedoic acid causes a total decrease of circulating LDL-C that normally damages blood vessels and leads to atherosclerosis.1,3,6 Lastly, ETC-1002 activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in rodents, which inhibits the synthesis of cholesterol via the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. The relevance of this to humans is unknown.2

NO is produced by all tissues of the body and plays very important roles in the cardiovascular system, immune system and nervous system. NO is formed from L-arginine via the enzyme nitric oxide synthase or synthetase (NOS), and the effects of NO are mainly mediated by 3,'5' -cyclic guanylate or cyclic GMP. NO activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase, which catalyzes the synthesis of cyclic GMP from guanosine triphosphate or GTP. Cyclic GMP is converted to guanylic acid via the enzyme cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase. NOS is a heme-containing enzyme with some sequences similar to cytochrome P-450 reductase. Several isoforms of NOS exist, two of which are constitutive and one of which is inducible by immunological stimuli. The constitutive NOS found in the vascular endothelium is designated eNOS and that present in the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nervous system is designated nNOS. The form of NOS induced by immunological or inflammatory stimuli is known as iNOS. iNOS may be expressed constitutively in select tissues such as lung epithelium. All the nitric oxide synthases use NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) and oxygen (O2) as cosubstrates, as well as the cofactors FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide), FMN (flavin mononucleotide), tetrahydrobiopterin and heme. Interestingly, ascorbic acid appears to enhance NOS activity by increasing intracellular tetrahydrobiopterin. eNOS and nNOS synthesize NO in response to an increased concentration of calcium ions or in some cases in response to calcium-independent stimuli, such as shear stress. In vitro studies of NOS indicate that the Km of the enzyme for L-arginine is in the micromolar range. The concentration of L-arginine in endothelial cells, as well as in other cells, and in plasma is in the millimolar range. What this means is that, under physiological conditions, NOS is saturated with its L-arginine substrate. In other words, L-arginine would not be expected to be rate-limiting for the enzyme, and it would not appear that supraphysiological levels of L-arginine which could occur with oral supplementation of the amino acid^would make any difference with regard to NO production. The reaction would appear to have reached its maximum level. However, in vivo studies have demonstrated that, under certain conditions, e.g. hypercholesterolemia, supplemental L-arginine could enhance endothelial-dependent vasodilation and NO production.

Salivary4 and gastric acid6 secretions are also partially mediated by the M1 receptor. Antagonism of these receptors decreases the volume of their respective secretions, and in the case of the gastrointestinal system, reduces the acidity of the stomach.7
In the cardiovascular system, muscarinic receptors M1 to M5 are all present, however the function of M5 has not been described in literature.7 Under normal circumstances, stimulation of the vagal nerve lowers the heart rate, potentially leading to intraoperative bradycardia.7 Studies in mice suggest that this stimulation is predominantly mediated by the M3 receptor, and mutant knockout mice are not susceptible to these effects.7

After binding the receptor the newly formed receptor-ligand complex translocates itself into the cell nucleus, where it binds to many glucocorticoid response elements (GRE) in the promoter region of the target genes. The DNA bound receptor then interacts with basic transcription factors, causing the increase in expression of specific target genes. The anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids are thought to involve lipocortins, phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins which, through inhibition arachidonic acid, control the biosynthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Specifically glucocorticoids induce lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis, which then binds to cell membranes preventing the phospholipase A2 from coming into contact with its substrate arachidonic acid. This leads to diminished eicosanoid production. The cyclooxygenase (both COX-1 and COX-2) expression is also suppressed, potentiating the effect. In other words, the two main products in inflammation Prostaglandins and Leukotrienes are inhibited by the action of Glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids also stimulate the lipocortin-1 escaping to the extracellular space, where it binds to the leukocyte membrane receptors and inhibits various inflammatory events: epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst and the release of various inflammatory mediators (lysosomal enzymes, cytokines, tissue plasminogen activator, chemokines etc.) from neutrophils, macrophages and mastocytes. Additionally the immune system is suppressed by corticosteroids due to a decrease in the function of the lymphatic system, a reduction in immunoglobulin and complement concentrations, the precipitation of lymphocytopenia, and interference with antigen-antibody binding.

It is possible that Li+ produces its effects by interacting with the transport of monovalent or divalent cations in neurons. An increasing number of scientists have come to the conclusion that the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is the key factor in understanding how lithium works. Lithium has been shown to change the inward and outward currents of glutamate receptors (especially GluR3), without a shift in reversal potential. Lithium has been found to exert a dual effect on glutamate receptors, acting to keep the amount of glutamate active between cells at a stable, healthy level, neither too much nor too little. It is postulated that too much glutamate in the space between neurons causes mania, and too little, depression. Another mechanism by which lithium might help to regulate mood include the non-competitive inhibition of an enzyme called inositol monophosphatase. Alternately lithium's action may be enhanced through the deactivation of the GSK-3B enzyme. The regulation of GSK-3B by lithium may affect the circadian clock. GSK-3 is known for phosphorylating and thus inactivating glycogen synthase. GSK-3B has also been implicated in the control of cellular response to damaged DNA. GSK-3 normally phosphorylates beta catenin, which leads to beta catenin degratation. When GSK-3 is inhibited, beta catenin increases and transgenic mice with overexpression of beta catenin express similar behaviour to mice treated with lithium. These results suggest that increase of beta catenin may be a possible pathway for the therapeutic action of lithium.

This is because, as a form of prostaglandinE1 (PGE1) it has multiple effects on blood flow. This results in increased pulmonary or systemic blood flow in infants. In cyanotic congenital heart disease, alprostadil's actions result in an increased oxygen supply to the tissues. In infants with interrupted aortic arch or very severe aortic coarctation, alprostadil maintains distal aortic perfusion by permitting blood flow through the DA from the pulmonary artery to the aorta. In infants with aortic coarctation, alprostadil reduces aortic obstruction either by relaxing ductus tissue in the aortic wall or by increasing effective aortic diameter by dilating the DA. In infants with these aortic arch anomalies, systemic blood flow to the lower body is increased, improving tissue oxygen supply and renal perfusion. When administered by intracavernosal injection or as an intraurethral suppository, alprostadil acts locally to relax the trabecular smooth muscle of the corpora cavernosa and the cavernosal arteries. Swelling, elongation, and rigidity of the penis result when arterial blood rapidly flows into the corpus cavernosum to expand the lacunar spaces. The entrapped blood reduces the venous blood outflow as sinusoids compress against the tunica albuginea.

Such interaction has been reported in a study that investigated the effects of neuronal outgrowth induced by beta amyloid peptides; while amyloid peptides cause lipid disorganization within the cell membranes leading to neuronal death, piracetam demonstrated to decrease the destabilizing effects of amyloid peptide 2. The authors suggest that piracetam induces a positive curvature of the membrane by occupying the polar groups in the phospholipids to counteract the negative curvature induced by amyloid peptides , which in turn would decrease the likelihood of membrane fusion 1. This mechanism of action is thought to improve membrane stability, allowing the membrane and transmembrane proteins to maintain and recover the three-dimensional structure or folding for normal function 4 such as membrane transport, chemical secretion, and receptor binding and stimulation 1. 
Through restored membrane fluidity, piracetam promotes restored neurotransmission such as glutamatergic and cholinergic systems, enhances neuroplasticity and mediates neuroprotective and anticonvulsant effects at the neuronal level 1. It is also demonstrated that piracetam also improves the fluidity of platelet membranes. At the vascular level, piracetam decreases adhesion of erythrocytes to cell wall and reduces vasospasm which in turn improves microcirculation including cerebral and renal blood flow 1."

Lovastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL and a significant reduction in the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.17,18,19,20,21
A significant effect on LDL-C reduction was seen within 2 weeks of initiation of lovastatin, and the maximum therapeutic response occurred within 4-6 weeks. The response was maintained during continuation of therapy. Single daily doses given in the evening were more effective than the same dose given in the morning, perhaps because cholesterol is synthesized mainly at night. When therapy with lovastatin is stopped, total cholesterol has been shown to return to pre-treatment levels.44
In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that lovastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.31 This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.
Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to ß2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.32
Lovastatin has been reported to have beneficial effects on certain cancers. This includes a multi-factorial stress-triggered cell death (apoptosis) and DNA degradation response in breast cancer cells.33 It has also been shown to inhibit histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) activity and increase the accumulation of acetylated histone-H3 and the expression of p21(WAF/CIP) in human cancer cells, suggesting that statins might serve as novel HDAC inhibitors for cancer therapy and chemoprevention.37

CCBs target L-type calcium channels, the major channel in muscle cells that mediates contraction. Similar to other DHP CCBs, isradipine binds directly to inactive calcium channels stabilizing their inactive conformation. Since arterial smooth muscle depolarizations are longer in duration than cardiac muscle depolarizations, inactive channels are more prevalent in smooth muscle cells. Alternative splicing of the alpha-1 subunit of the channel gives isradipine additional arterial selectivity. At therapeutic sub-toxic concentrations, isradipine has little effect on cardiac myocytes and conduction cells.

This metabolite is responsible for essentially all of the drug's activity in-vivo. The mechanism of action of leflunomide has not been fully determined, but appears to primarily involve regulation of autoimmune lymphocytes. It has been suggested that leflunomide exerts its immunomodulating effects by preventing the expansion of activated autoimmune lymphocytes via interferences with cell cycle progression. In-vitro data indicates that leflunomide interferes with cell cycle progression by inhibiting dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (a mitochondrial enzyme involved in de novo pyrimidine ribonucleotide uridine monophosphate (rUMP)synthesis) and has antiproliferative activity. Human dihydroorotate dehydrogenase consists of 2 domains: an a/ß-barrel domain containing the active site and an a-helical domain that forms a tunnel leading to the active site. A77 1726 binds to the hydrophobic tunnel at a site near the flavin mononucleotide. Inhibition of dihydroorotate dehydrogenase by A77 1726 prevents production of rUMP by the de novo pathway; such inhibition leads to decreased rUMP levels, decreased DNA and RNA synthesis, inhibition of cell proliferation, and G1 cell cycle arrest. It is through this action that leflunomide inhibits autoimmune T-cell proliferation and production of autoantibodies by B cells. Since salvage pathways are expected to sustain cells arrested in the G1 phase, the activity of leflunomide is cytostatic rather than cytotoxic. Other effects that result from reduced rUMP levels include interference with adhesion of activated lymphocytes to the synovial vascular endothelial cells, and increased synthesis of immunosuppressive cytokines such as transforming growth factor-ß (TGF-ß). Leflunomide is also a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Tyrosine kinases activate signalling pathways leading to DNA repair, apoptosis and cell proliferation. Inhibition of tyrosine kinases can help to treating cancer by preventing repair of tumor cells.

Renin acts on the precursor prottein angiotensinogen, which is a plasma globulin synthesized from the liver, to produce cleaved peptide hormone angiotensin I.9 Angiotensin I then can be further cleaved by ACE to produce angiotensin II, a vasoconstrictive peptide hormone.Label Present in different isoforms, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is peptidyl dipeptidase enzyme expressed in various tissues, including the vascular tissues, such as the heart, brain, and kidneys.9 ACE also plays a role in inactivation of bradykinin, a potent vasodepressor peptide.9,Label Angiotensin II mediates various actions on the body by working on its G-protein coupled receptors, AT1 and AT2.9 It causes direct vasoconstriction of precapillary arterioles and postcapillary venules, inhibits the reuptake of NE thereby increasing available levels, stimulates the release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla, reduces urinary excretion of sodium ions and water by promoting proximal tubular reabsorption, stimulates synthesis and release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, and stimulates hypertrophy of both vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiac myocytes.11
Enalapril is a pharmacologically inactive prodrug that requires hepatic biotransformation to form enalaprilat, its active metabolite that works on the RAAS to inhibit ACE.Label Biotransformation is critial for the therapeutic actions of the drug, as enalapril itself is only a weak inhibitor of ACE.4 ACE inhibition results in reduced production and plasma levels of angiotensin II, increased plasma renin activity due to the loss of feedback inhibition by angiotensin II, and decreased aldosterone secretion.10 However, plasma aldosterone levels usually return to normal during long-term administration of enalapril.7 Decreased levels of angiotensin II subsequently leads to the dilatation of peripheral vessles and reduced vascular resistance which in turn lower blood pressure.7 While inhibition of ACE leading to suppression of RAAS is thought to be the primary mechanism of action of enalapril, the drug was shown to still exert antihypertensive effects on individuals with low-renin hypertension. It is suggested that enalapril may mediate its pharmacological actions via other modes of action that are not fully understood.Label As ACE is structurally similar to kininase I, which is a carboxypeptidase that degrades bradykinin, whether increased levels of bradykinin play a role in the therapeutic effects of enalapril remains to be elucidated.Label

FECH is required to insert iron into protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) to generate heme, and a deficiency in FECH results in accumulation of PPIX (particularly in the liver and superficial skin vasculature). PPIX molecules are photodynamic - exposure to UV radiation causes these molecules to form reactive oxygen species that lead to subsequent tissue damage.1
Afamelanotide mimics endogenous alpha melanocyte-stimulating hormone (a-MSH), a hormone typically released in response to UV-induced skin damage. Both afamelanotide and a-MSH bind to the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1R) on melanocytes which stimulates the synthesis of eumelanin, a photoprotective compound. Eumelanin is incorporated into small vesicles called melanosomes which are then distributed to surrounding keratinocytes. Melanosomes are concentrated above the nucleus of these keratinocytes, thus protecting them from UV-induced damage.2 While endogenous a-MSH requires UV-induced skin damage in order to be produced, afamelanotide increases eumelanin biosynthesis independent of UV exposure.3
Activation of MC1R signalling by afamelanotide also instigates other protective processes, including an increase in antioxidant activity, DNA repair, and secretion of immunomodulatory proteins such as interleukin-10.2

While agonism of the µ-opioid receptor is the primary mechanism of action for the treatment of pain, methadone also acts as an agonist of <U+03BA>- and s-opioid receptors within the central and peripheral nervous systems. Interestingly, methadone differs from morphine (which is considered the gold standard reference opioid) in its antagonism of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor and its strong inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine uptake, which likely also contributes to its antinociceptive activity.2
Methadone is administered as a 50:50 racemic mixture of (R)- and (S)-stereoisomers, with (R)-methadone demonstrating ~10-fold higher affinity and potency for the µ-opioid receptor than the (S) stereoisomer.2 The analgesic activity of the racemate is almost entirely due to the (R)-isomer, while the (S)-isomer lacks significant respiratory depressant activity but does have antitussive effects.
While methadone shares similar effects and risks of other opioids such as morphine, hydromorphone, oxycodone, and fentanyl it has a number of unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that distinguish it from them and make it a useful agent for the treatment of opioid addiction. For example, methadone abstinence syndrome, although qualitatively similar to that of morphine, differs in that the onset is slower, the course is more prolonged, and the symptoms are less severe.

Olaparib is a PARP inhibitor: while it acts on PARP1, PARP2, and PARP3, olaparib is a more selective competitive inhibitor of NAD+ at the catalytic site of PARP1 and PARP2. Inhibition of the BER pathway by olaparib leads to the accumulation of unrepaired SSBs, which leads to the formation of DSBs, which is the most toxic form of DNA damage. While BRCA-dependent homologous recombination can repair DSBs in normal cells, this repair pathway is defective in cells with BRCA1/2 mutations, such as certain tumour cells.4 Inhibition of PARP in cancer cells with BRCA mutations leads to genomic instability and apoptotic cell death. This end result is also referred to as synthetic lethality, a phenomenon where the combination of two defects - inhibition of PARP activity and loss of DSB repair by HR - that are otherwise benign when alone, lead to detrimental results.2
In vitro studies have shown that olaparib-induced cytotoxicity may involve inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP-DNA complexes, resulting in DNA damage and cancer cell death.8

The disease myasthenia gravis occurs when the body inappropriately produces antibodies against acetylcholine receptors, and thus inhibits proper acetylcholine signal transmission (when acetylcholine binds to acetylcholine receptors of striated muscle fibers, it stimulates those fibers to contract). Ambenonium reversibly binds acetylcholinesterase at the anionic site, which results in the blockage of the site of acetycholine binding, thereby inhibiting acetylcholine hydrolysis and enhancing cholinergic function through the accumulation of acetycholine at cholinergic synpases. Elevated acetylcholine levels lead to facilitates transmission of impulses across the myoneural junction.

However, with continuous daily administration, nafarelin continuously occupies the GnRH receptor, leading to a reversible down-regulation of the GnRH receptors in the pituitary gland and desensitization of the pituitary gonadotropes. This causes a significant and sustained decline in the production of LH and FSH. A decline in gonadotropin production and release causes a dramatic reversible decrease in synthesis of estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone by the ovaries or testes. Like normal endometrium, endometriotic implants contain estrogen receptors. Estrogen stimulates the growth of endometrium. Use of nafarelin induces anovulation and amenorrhea and decreases serum concentrations of estradiol to the postmenopausal range, which induces atrophy of endometriotic implants. However, nafarelin does not abolish the underlying pathophysiology of endometriosis. In children with central precocious puberty receiving nafarelin, serum LH, testosterone, and estradiol concentrations return to prepubertal levels. This results in the supression of secondary sexual characteristics and decrased rate of linear growth and skeletal maturation. Following disconinuation of nafarelin, the effects of the drug is reversed, meaning FSH and LH concentrations usually return to pretreatment levels.

In general, antioxidants protect cells from the damaging effects of free radicals, which are molecules that consist of an unshared electron 5. These unshared electrons are highly energetic and react rapidly with oxygen to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) 5. In doing so, free radicals are capable of damaging cells, which may facilitate their contribution to the development of various diseases 5. Moreover, the human body naturally forms ROS when it converts food into energy and is also exposed to environmental free radicals contained in cigarette smoke, air pollution, or ultraviolet radiation from the sun 5. It is believed that perhaps vitamin E antioxidants might be able to protect body cells from the damaging effects of such frequent free radical and ROS exposure 5.
Specifically, vitamin E is a chain-breaking antioxidant that prevents the propagation of free radical reactions 4. The vitamin E molecule is specifically a peroxyl radical scavenger and especially protects polyunsaturated fatty acids within endogenous cell membrane phospholipids and plasma lipoproteins 4. Peroxyl free radicals react with vitamin E a thousand times more rapidly than they do with the aforementioned polyunsaturated fatty acids 4. Furthermore, the phenolic hydroxyl group of tocopherol reacts with an organic peroxyl radical to form an organic hydroperoxide and tocopheroxyl radical 4. This tocopheroxyl radical can then undergo various possible reactions: it could (a) be reduced by other antioxidants to tocopherol, (b) react with another tocopheroxyl radical to form non-reactive products like tocopherol dimers, (c) undergo further oxidation to tocopheryl quinone, or (d) even act as a prooxidant and oxidize other lipids 4.
In addition to the antioxidant actions of vitamin E, there have been a number of studies that report various other specific molecular functions associated with vitamin E 4. For example, alpha-tocopherol is capable of inhibiting protein kinase C activity, which is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation in smooth muscle cells, human platelets, and monocytes 4. In particular, protein kinase C inhibition by alpha-tocopherol is partially attributable to its attenuating effect on the generation of membrane-derived dialglycerol, a lipid that facilitates protein kinase C translocation, thereby increasing its activity 4.
In addition, vitamin E enrichment of endothelial cells downregulates the expression of intercellular cell adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), thereby decreasing the adhesion of blood cell components to the endothelium 4.
Vitamin E also upregulates the expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase-1 4. The increased expression of these two rate-limiting enzymes in the arachidonic acid cascade explains the observation that vitamin E, in a dose-dependent fashion, enhanced the release of prostacyclin, a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation in humans 4.
Furthermore, vitamin E can inhibit platelet adhesion, aggregation, and platelet release reactions 4. The vitamin can also evidently inhibit the plasma generation of thrombin, a potent endogenous hormone that binds to platelet receptors and induces aggregation of platelets 4. Moreover, vitamin E may also be able to decrease monocyte adhesion to the endothellium by downregulating expression of adhesion molecules and decreasing monocyte superoxide production 4.
Given these proposed biological activities of vitamin E, the substance continues to generate ongoing interest and studies in whether or not vitamin E can assist in delaying or preventing various diseases with any one or more of its biologic actions. For instance, studies continue to see whether vitamin E's ability to inhibit low-density lipoprotein oxidation can aid in preventing the development of cardiovascular disease or atherogenesis 4.
Similarly, it is also believed that if vitamin E can decrease the chance of cardiovascular disease then it can also decrease the chance of related diabetic disease and complications 4. In much the same way, it is also believed that perhaps the antioxidant abilities of vitamin E can neutralize free radicals that are constantly reacting and damaging cellular DNA 4. Furthermore, it is also believed that free radical damage does contribute to protein damage in the ocular lens - another free radical-mediated condition that may potentially be prevented by vitamin E use 4. Where it is also suggested that various central nervous system disorders like Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome, and Tardive Dyskinesia possess some form of oxidative stress component, it is also proposed that perhaps vitamin E use could assist with its antioxidant action 4.
There have also been studies that report the possibility of vitamin E supplementation can improve or reverse the natural decline in cellular immune function in healthy, elderly individuals 4.
As of this time however, there is either only insufficient data or even contradicting data (where certain doses of vitamin E supplementation could even potentially increase all-cause mortality) 1 on which to suggest the use of vitamin E could formally benefit in any of these proposed indications.

By increasing the delivery of sodium to the distal renal tubule, Chlorthalidone indirectly increases potassium excretion via the sodium-potassium exchange mechanism. The exact mechanism of chlorthalidone's anti-hypertensive effect is under debate, however, it is thought that increased diuresis results in decreased plasma and extracellular fluid volume which therefore requires decreased cardiac output and overall lowers blood pressure.5 Chlorthalidone has also been shown to decrease platelet aggregation and vascular permeability, as well as promote angiogenesis in vitro, which is thought to be partly the result of reductions in carbonic anhydrase–dependent pathways. These pathways may play a role in chlorthalidone's cardiovascular risk reduction effects.7

Unlike the stable cell line assays, Ataluren did not discriminate significantly between the UAG and UAA mRNAs. Ataluren was a more potent nonsense-suppressing agent than gentamicin, and exhibited 4- to 15-fold stimulation of in vitro readthrough relative to the controls at levels similar to those in the stable cell reporter assays.

Cetylpyridinium chloride is a quaternary ammonium compound that demonstrates a broad spectrum anti-bacterial activity 3. It possesses a cationic surface active agent surfactant which can absorb readily to oral surfaces 3. The molecules of this agent have both hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups 3. In action, the positively charged hydrophilic region of cetylpyridinium chloride molecules enables the compound to interact with microbial cell surfaces and even integrate into the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane 3. Consequently, there is a resultant disruption of bacterial membrane integrity causing a leakage of bacterial cytoplasmic components, interference with cellular metabolism, inhibition of cell growth, and ultimately - cell death 3. Moreover, cetylpyridinium chloride can also inhibit the synthesis of insoluble glucan by streptococcal glucosyltransferase, adsorb to pellicle-covered enamel, and inhibit co-adhesion of bacteria, and bind streptococcus mutans biofilms 3. This ability of cetylpyridinium chloride to be able to adsorb to pellicle covered enamel imparts substantivity to the compound molecules - that is retention in the mouth and continued antimicrobial activity for a period of time after rinsing 3. Taking these mechanisms into consideration, cetylpyridinium chloride may be considered an active ingredient that is effective in the treatment and prevention of bacterial or fungal disorders of the oropharyngeal cavity 1."

Iloprost constricts the ilium and fundus circular smooth muscle as strongly as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) itself. Iloprost inhibits the ADP, thrombin, and collagen-induced aggregation of human platelets. In whole animals, iloprost acts as a vasodilator, hypotensive, antidiuretic, and prolongs bleeding time.

Oral contraceptives containing levonorgestrel suppress gonadotropins, inhibiting ovulation. Specifically, levonorgestrel binds to progesterone and androgen receptors and slows the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus. This process results in the suppression of the normal physiological luteinizing hormone (LH) surge that precedes ovulation. It inhibits the rupture of follicles and viable egg release from the ovaries. Levonorgestrel has been proven to be more effective when administered before ovulation.18
Mechanism of action in cervical mucus changes
Similar to other levonorgestrel-containing contraceptives, the intrauterine (IUD) forms of levonorgestrel likely prevent pregnancy by increasing the thickness of cervical mucus, interfering with the movement and survival of sperm, and inducing changes in the endometrium, where a fertilized ovum is usually implanted.21,22 Levonorgestrel is reported to alter the consistency of mucus in the cervix, which interferes with sperm migration into the uterus for fertilization. Levonorgestrel is not effective after implantation has occurred.3
Interestingly, recent evidence has refuted the commonly believed notion that levonorgestrel changes the consistency of cervical mucus when it is taken over a short-term period, as in emergency contraception. Over a long-term period, however, levonorgestrel has been proven to thicken cervical mucus.3 The exact mechanism of action of levonorgestrel is not completely understood and remains a topic of controversy and ongoing investigation.3,19
Effects on implantation*
The effects of levonorgestrel on endometrial receptivity are unclear, and the relevance of this mechanism to the therapeutic efficacy of levonorgestrel is contentious.15,16 Prescribing information for levonorgestrel IUDs state that they exert local morphological changes to the endometrium (e.g. stromal pseudodecidualization, glandular atrophy) that may play a role in their contraceptive activity.21,22
Mechanism of action in hormone therapy
When combined with estrogens for the treatment of menopausal symptoms and prevention of osteoporosis, levonorgestrel serves to lower the carcinogenic risk of unopposed estrogen therapy via the inhibition of endometrial proliferation. Unregulated endometrial proliferation sometimes leads to endometrial cancer after estrogen use.28

Loratadine binds to H1 histamine receptors found on the surface of epithelial cells, endothelial cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, airway cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells among others.7 H1 histamine receptors fall under the wider umbrella of G-protein coupled receptors, and exist in a state of equilibrium between the active and inactive forms.78 Histamine binding to the H1-receptor facilitates cross linking between transmembrane domains III and V, stabilizing the active form of the receptor.78 On the other hand, antihistamines bind to a different site on the H1 receptor favouring the inactive form.78
Hence, loratadine can more accurately be classified as an \inverse agonist\ as opposed to a \histamine antagonist\, and can prevent or reduce the severity of histamine mediated symptoms.7817

Once hydrolyzed, simvastatin competes with HMG-CoA for HMG-CoA reductase, a hepatic microsomal enzyme, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis.2 Simvastatin acts primarily in the liver, where decreased hepatic cholesterol concentrations stimulate the upregulation of hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors which increases hepatic uptake of LDL. Simvastatin also inhibits hepatic synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL).29,30 The overall effect is a decrease in plasma LDL and VLDL. 
At therapeutic doses, the HMG-CoA enzyme is not completely blocked by simvastatin activity, thereby allowing biologically necessary amounts of mevalonate to remain available. As mevalonate is an early step in the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol, therapy with simvastatin would also not be expected to cause any accumulation of potentially toxic sterols. In addition, HMG-CoA is metabolized readily back to acetyl-CoA, which participates in many biosynthetic processes in the body.30
In vitro and in vivo animal studies also demonstrate that simvastatin exerts vasculoprotective effects independent of its lipid-lowering properties, also known as the pleiotropic effects of statins.15 This includes improvement in endothelial function, enhanced stability of atherosclerotic plaques, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of the thrombogenic response.
Statins have also been found to bind allosterically to ß2 integrin function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1), which plays an important role in leukocyte trafficking and in T cell activation.17

MR instruments are sensitive to two different relaxation processes, the T1 (spin-lattice or longitudinal relaxation time) and T2 (spin-spin or transverse relaxation time). Paramagnetic agents contain one or more unpaired electrons that enhance the T1 and T2 relaxation rates of protons in their molecular environment. The proton relaxation effect (PRE) of an unpaired electron is 700 times stronger than that of a proton itself. In MRI, visualization of normal and pathological brain tissue depends in part on variations in the radio frequency signal intensity that occur with changes in proton density, alteration of the T1, and variation in T2. When placed in a magnetic field, gadopentetate dimeglumine shortens the T1 and T2 relaxation times in tissues where it accumulates. In the central nervous system (CNS), gadopentetate dimeglumine enhances visualization of normal tissues that lack a blood-brain barrier, such as the pituitary gland and the meninges. Gadopentetate dimeglumine does not cross the intact blood-brain barrier; therefore, it does not accumulate in normal brain tissue or in CNS lesions that have not caused an abnormal blood-brain barrier (e.g., cysts, mature post-operative scars). Abnormal vascularity or disruption of the blood-brain barrier allows accumulation of gadopentetate dimeglumine in lesions such as neoplasms, abscesses, and subacute infarcts. Outside the CNS, gadopentetate dimeglumine rapidly reaches equilibrium in the interstitial compartment and enhances signal in all tissues as a function of delivery and size of the interstitial compartment.
This compound has also been found to inhibit human erythrocyte 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase.

The antihypertensive actions of Reserpine are a result of its ability to deplete catecholamines from peripheral sympathetic nerve endings. These substances are normally involved in controlling heart rate, the work of cardiac contraction and peripheral resistance 12. Reserpine depletes brain (depression) and peripheral (PPH) noradrenaline (NA) storage sites, guanethidine depleted NA storage via blockade of reuptake 14.
This agent binds and inhibits catecholamine pump on the storage vesicles in central and peripheral adrenergic neurons, thereby inhibiting the uptake of norepinephrine, dopamine serotonin into presynaptic storage vesicles. This results in catecholamines and serotonin lingering in the cytoplasm where they are destroyed by intraneuronal monoamine oxidase, thereby causing the depletion of catecholamine and serotonin stores in central and peripheral nerve terminals. Depletion results in a lack of active transmitter discharge from nerve endings upon nerve depolarization, and consequently leads to a decreased heart rate and decreased arterial blood pressure as well as sedative effects 12.

Carboxylation induces a conformational change allowing the factors to bind Ca2+ and to phospholipid surfaces. Uncarboxylated factors VII, IX, X, and thrombin are biologically inactive and therefore serve to interrupt the coagulation cascade. The endogenous anticoagulation proteins C and S also require <U+03B3>-carboxylation to function. This is particularly true in the case of thrombin which must be activated in order to form a thrombus. vitamin KH2 is converted to vitamin K epoxide as part of the <U+03B3>-carboxylation reaction catalyzed by <U+03B3>-glutamyl carboxylase. Vitamin K epoxide is then converted to vitamin K1 by vitamin K epoxide reductase then back to vitamin KH2 by vitamin K reductase. Warfarin binds to vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 and irreversibly inhibits the enzyme thereby stopping the recycling of vitamin K by preventing the conversion of vitamin K epoxide to vitamin K1. This process creates a hypercoagulable state for a short time as proteins C and S degrade first with half lives of 8 and 24 hours, with the exception of factor VII which has a half life of 6 hours.14 Factors IX, X, and finally thrombin degrade later with half lives of 24, 36, and 50 hours resulting in a dominant anticoagulation effect.14 In order to reverse this anticoagulation vitamin K must be supplied, either exogenously or by removal of the vitamin K epoxide reductase inhibition, and time allowed for new coagulation factors to be synthesized.Label,14,16 It takes approximately 2 days for new coagulation factors to be synthesized in the liver. Vitamin K2, functionally identical to vitamin K1, is synthesized by gut bacteria leading to interactions with antibiotics as elimination of these bacteria can reduce vitamin K216

In general, so-called cardioselective beta-blockers are relatively cardioselective; at lower doses they block beta-1 receptors only but begin to block beta-2 receptors as the dose increases. At therapeutic dosages, esmolol does not have intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA) or membrane-stabilizing (quinidine-like) activity. Antiarrhythmic activity is due to blockade of adrenergic stimulation of cardiac pacemaker potentials. In the Vaughan Williams classification of antiarrhythmics, beta-blockers are considered to be class II agents.

In lactotrophs, stimulation of dopamine D2 causes inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, which decreases intracellular cAMP concentrations and blocks IP3-dependent release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. Decreases in intracellular calcium levels may also be brought about via inhibition of calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels, rather than via inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Additionally, receptor activation blocks phosphorylation of p42/p44 MAPK and decreases MAPK/ERK kinase phosphorylation. Inhibition of MAPK appears to be mediated by c-Raf and B-Raf-dependent inhibition of MAPK/ERK kinase. Dopamine-stimulated growth hormone release from the pituitary gland is mediated by a decrease in intracellular calcium influx through voltage-gated calcium channels rather than via adenylyl cyclase inhibition. Stimulation of dopamine D2 receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway leads to improvements in coordinated muscle activity in those with movement disorders. Cabergoline is a long-acting dopamine receptor agonist with a high affinity for D2 receptors. Receptor-binding studies indicate that cabergoline has low affinity for dopamine D1, a1,- and a2- adrenergic, and 5-HT1- and 5-HT2-serotonin receptors.

They modulate lymphocyte function, including T-helper (Th) 1 and Th17 cell subsets,2 as CD4+ T cells can differentiate into T-helper (Th) effector lineages based on the environment. Th cells can further activate the downstream pro-inflammatory mediators and transcription factors such as TNFa and IFN<U+03B3> that drive innate and adaptive immunity.4
IL-12 and IL-23 share a common p40 subunit, paired with p35 and p19 subunits of IL-12 and IL-23, respectively.
4 The antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of ustekinumab binds the D1 domain of the p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23 in a 1:1 ratio.4 This prevents IL-12 and IL-23 from binding to the IL-12Rß1 receptor chain of IL-12 (IL-12Rß1/ß2) and IL-23 (IL-12Rß1/23R) receptor complexes on the surface of NK and T cells.2 Ustekinumab only binds to IL-12 and IL-23 that are unbound to IL-12Rß1,8 so it is unlikely to initiate Fc effector functions, such as ADCC or CDC.2 Inhibition of the IL-12/23 signalling pathway leads to profound suppression of both the Th1 and Th17 cell lineage of cytokines and chemokines and their inflammatory pathways.3

Emesis or vomiting is controlled by the vomiting centre in the medulla region of the brain, an important part of which is the chemotrigger zone (CTZ). The vomiting centre possesses neurons which are rich in muscarinic cholinergic and histamine containing synapses. These types of neurons are especially involved in transmission from the vestibular apparatus to the vomiting centre. Motion sickness principally involves overstimulation of these pathways due to various sensory stimuli. Hence the action of cyclizine which acts to block the histamine receptors in the vomiting centre and thus reduce activity along these pathways. Furthermore since cyclizine possesses anti-cholinergic properties as well, the muscarinic receptors are similarly blocked.

Emesis or vomiting is controlled by the vomiting centre in the medulla region of the brain, an important part of which is the chemotrigger zone (CTZ). The vomiting centre possesses neurons which are rich in muscarinic cholinergic and histamine containing synapses. These types of neurons are especially involved in transmission from the vestibular apparatus to the vomiting centre. Motion sickness principally involves overstimulation of these pathways due to various sensory stimuli. Hence the action of buclizine which acts to block the histamine receptors in the vomiting centre and thus reduce activity along these pathways. Furthermore since buclizine possesses anti-cholinergic properties as well, the muscarinic receptors are similarly blocked.

It interacts with a GABA-BZ receptor complex and shares various pharmacological properties with the benzodiazepine class of drugs Label.
Subunit binding of the GABAA receptor chloride channel macromolecular complex is thought to lead to the sedative, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and myorelaxant drug effects of zolpidem. The main regulatory site of the GABAA receptor complex can be found on its alpha (a) subunit and is called the benzodiazepine (BZ) or omega (<U+03C9>) receptor. At least three different subtypes of the (<U+03C9>) receptor have been identified to this date Label.
In contrast to benzodiazepine drugs, which are found to modulate all benzodiazepine receptor subtypes in a non-selective fashion, zolpidem binds the (BZ1) receptor specifically with a potent affinity for the alpha 1/alpha 5 subunits (in vitro) Label. More recent studies suggest that zolpidem binds primarily to the alpha 1, 2, and 3 subunits of the GABA receptor 11, 12, 13, and not the alpha 5 subunit. 
The (BZ1) receptor is found primarily on the Lamina IV of the brain sensorimotor cortical regions, substantia nigra (pars reticulata), cerebellum molecular layer, olfactory bulb, ventral thalamic complex, pons, inferior colliculus, and globus pallidus. Specific and selective binding of zolpidem on the (BZ1) receptor is not considered absolute, however, this binding could potentially explain the relative lack of myorelaxant and anticonvulsant activity in animal studies in addition to the preservation of deep sleep (stages 3 and 4) in human studies of zolpidem at hypnotic doses Label.

Mifamurtide is referred to as MTP-PE or L-MTP-PE (in case of the liposomal formulation), which is a fully synthetic derivative of muramyl dipeptide (MDP), which is a motif within the peptidoglycan polymer in the cell wall of bacteria. 
MDP stimulates the immune system by being recognized by different pattern recognition molecules and receptors, such as nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) 2 receptor and toll-like receptor (TLR). Similarly, mifamurtide acts as a ligand for TRL4 and NOD2. Involved in the innate immunity, NOD2 is an intracellular MDP sensor that is primarily expressed on monocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages. It possesses an amino-terminal caspase recruitment domain, which is required to trigger nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-<U+03BA>B) signaling 2. Activation of intracellular signaling transduction pathway NF-<U+03BA>B can promote inflammation and release of antimicrobial peptides, resulting in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and TNF-a, and other molecules such as chemokines and adhesion molecules 2. Upon binding to TLR4, mifamurtide may activate extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2), nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-<U+03BA>B) and adaptor protein (AP)-1 1. Mifamurtide may also activate NLRP3, which is an essential component of the inflammasome, a protein complex that promotes the cleavage of procaspase 1 into its active form. Active caspase 1 further activates pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1ß 2. Furthermore, mifamurtide induces the expression of adhesion molecules including lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1, intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR 1. Mifamurtide may interact with interferon (IFN)-<U+03B3> to up-regulate tumoricidal activity 1.
Upon intravenous administration, lipophilic mifamurtide is selectively phagocytosed by monocytes and macrophages followed by subsequent degradation of liposomal vesicles by the phagocytic cells. Then, MTP-PE is released into the cytosol where it interacts with Nod2 and activates the macrophages and monocytes 1. Mifamurtide exerts a tumoricidal action via the same signalling pathway as MDP but with greater superiority because the lipophilic properties of MTP-PE cause higher cell uptake via passive transfer through the cytoplasmic membrane 1. Incorporation of MTP-PE into liposomal structures allows better safety profile and more efficient distribution to the liver, spleen, and lungs after intravenous administration 1.

Azithromycin binds to the 23S rRNA of the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit. It stops bacterial protein synthesis by inhibiting the transpeptidation/translocation step of protein synthesis and by inhibiting the assembly of the 50S ribosomal subunit Label, 5. This results in the control of various bacterial infections 7, Label. The strong affinity of macrolides, including azithromycin, for bacterial ribosomes, is consistent with their broad-spectrum antibacterial activities 7.
Azithromycin is highly stable at a low pH, giving it a longer serum half-life and increasing its concentrations in tissues compared to erythromycin 4.

There is also evidence of inhibition of histamine, leukotrienes, and cytokines3.
Corticosteroids diffuse across cell membranes into the cytosol of cells where they bind to glucocorticoid receptors to produce their activity2. Mometasone furoate has a particularly high receptor affinity compare to other corticosteroids, 22 times higher than that of dexamethasone2. Mometasone furoate binding to a glucocorticoid receptor causes conformational changes in the receptor, separation from chaperones, and the receptor moves to the nucleus3. Once at the nucleus, receptors dimerize and bind to a DNA sequence known as the glucocorticoid response element which either increases expression of anti-inflammatory molecules or inhibits expression of pro-inflammatory molecules (such as interleukins 4 and 5)3. Mometasone furoate also reduces inflammation by blocking transcription factors such as activator-protein-1 and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB)2,3.

Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays several important roles in cells, and most importantly, it is a crucial neurotransmitter involved in reward processing and motivation. The nigrostriatal, mesolimbic, and mesocortical systems consist of dopaminergic projections. The dopamine hypothesis states that dopaminergic aberrations are observed in schizophrenia and bipolar disorders.7,8 For example, hyperactive dopamine D2 receptor activity has been associated with positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations and delusions. On the other hand, alterations in dopamine D3 receptors may be involved in producing negative symptoms of schizophrenia.7 It was stated that hyperdopaminergia, caused by elevations in D2/3 receptor availability and a hyperactive reward processing network, underlies the development of mania in bipolar disorder.8
The exact mechanism of action of cariprazine is not fully elucidated. Cariprazine potently binds to both of these receptors, more preferably to D3 receptors with higher affinity.2 Preclinical studies suggest that D3 receptor blockade is associated with exerting pro-cognitive and antidepressant effects and attenuating negative symptoms in schizophrenia.5 This unique mechanism of action differs from that of other antipsychotic agents that mostly target D2 and 5-HT2A receptors.3 Cariprazine is also a partial agonist at 5-HT1A receptors, an antagonist at 5-HT2B and 5-HT2A receptors, an antagonist at histamine H1 receptors. It also binds to 5-HT2C, alpha (a)-1A adrenergic, and alpha (a)-1B adrenergic receptors with low affinity.2,5

Although chemically unrelated, lamotrigine actions resemble those of phenytoin and carbamazepine, inhibiting voltage-sensitive sodium channels, stabilizing neuronal membranes, thereby modulating the release of presynaptic excitatory neurotransmitters.7,10,14
Lamotrigine likely acts by inhibiting sodium currents by selective binding to the inactive sodium channel, suppressing the release of the excitatory amino acid, glutamate. The mechanism of action of lamotrigine in reducing anticonvulsant activity is likely the same in managing bipolar disorder. Studies on lamotrigine have identified its binding to sodium channels in a fashion similar to local anesthetics, which could explain the demonstrated clinical benefit of lamotrigine in some neuropathic pain states.13
Lamotrigine displays binding properties to several different receptors. In laboratory binding assays, it demonstrates weak inhibitory effect on the serotonin 5-HT3 receptor. Lamotrigine also weakly binds to Adenosine A1/A2 receptors, a1/a2/ß adrenergic receptors, dopamine D1/D2 receptors, GABA A/B receptors, histamine H1 receptors, <U+03BA>-opioid receptor (KOR), mACh receptors and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors with an IC50>100 µM. Weak inhibitory effects were observed at sigma opioid receptors.14 An in vivo study revealed evidence that lamotrigine inhibits Cav2.3 (R-type) calcium currents, which may also contribute to its anticonvulsant effects.6

When GABA binds to GABA(a) receptors found in neuron synapses, chloride ions are conducted across neuron cell membranes via an ion channel in the receptors 6,7,13,14. With enough chloride ions conducted, the local, associated neuron membrane potentials are hyperpolarized - making it more difficult or less likely for action potentials to fire, ultimately resulting in less excitation of the neurons 6,7,13,14. 
Subsequently, benzodiazepines like temazepam can bind to benzodiazepine receptors that are components of various varieties of GABA(a) receptors 6,7,13,14. This binding acts to enhance the effects of GABA by increasing GABA affinity for the GABA(a) receptor, which ultimately enhances GABA ligand binding at the receptors 6,7,13,14. This enhanced ligand binding of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA to the receptors increases the aforementioned chloride ion conduction (perhaps reportedly via an increase in the frequency of the chloride channel opening), resulting in a hyperpolarized cell membrane that prevents further excitation of the associated neuron cells 6,7,13,14. Combined with the notion that such benzodiazepine receptor associated GABA(a) receptors exist both peripherally and in the CNS, this activity consequently facilitates various effects like sedation, hypnosis, skeletal muscle relaxation, anticonvulsant activity, and anxiolytic action 6,7,13,14.

Erdosteine acts to regulate the production of mucus in the airway and regulates its viscosity while enhancing mucociliary transport. This leads to an increase in expectoration. Erdosteine shows inhibition against the effects of free radicals from cigarette smoke. Clinical studies in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) have shown that this drug is generally safe and well tolerated. Erdosteine 300mg twice daily reduced cough (both frequency and severity) and sputum viscosity more quickly and more effectively than placebo and reduced the adhesivity of sputum more effectively than ambroxol 30mg twice daily. Co-administration of erdosteine and amoxicillin in patients with acute infective exacerbation of chronic bronchitis resulted in higher concentrations of the antibiotic in the sputum, leading to earlier and more pronounced amelioration of clinical symptoms compared with placebo.

Afatinib covalently binds to and irreversibly blocks signaling from all homo and heterodimers formed by the ErbB family members EGFR (ErbB1), HER2 (ErbB2), ErbB3 and ErbB4 3.
In particular, afatinib covalently binds to the kinase domains of EGFR (ErbB1), HER2 (ErbB2), and HER4 (ErbB4) and irreversibly inhibits tyrosine kinase autophosphorylation, resulting in downregulation of ErbB signaling Label. Certain mutations in EGFR, including non-resistant mutations in its kinase domain, can result in increased autophosphorylation of the receptor, leading to receptor activation, sometimes in the absence of ligand binding, and can support cell proliferation in NSCLC Label. Non-resistant mutations are defined as those occurring in exons constituting the kinase domain of EGFR that lead to increased receptor activation and where efficacy is predicted by 1) clinically meaningful tumor shrinkage with the recommended dose of afatinib and/or 2) inhibition of cellular proliferation or EGFR tyrosine kinase phosphorylation at concentrations of afatinib sustainable at the recommended dosage according to validated methods Label. The most commonly found of these mutations are exon 21 L858R substitutions and exon 19 deletions Label.
Moreover, afatinib demonstrated inhibition of autophosphorylation and/or in vitro proliferation of cell lines expressing wild-type EGFR and in those expressing selected EGFR exon 19 deletion mutations, exon 21 L858R mutations, or other less common non-resistant mutations, at afatinib concentrations achieved in patients Label. In addition, afatinib inhibited in vitro proliferation of cell lines overexpressing HER2 Label.

Primarily defined histopathologically by necrosis and microvascular proliferation (WHO grade IV classification), glioblastomas are commonly treated through radiotherapy and concomitant alkylation-based chemotherapy with temozolomide.9 Temozolomide (TMZ) is a small (194 Da) lipophilic alkylating agent of the imidazotetrazine class that is stable at acidic pH, allowing for both oral and intravenous dosing, and can cross the blood-brain barrier to affect CNS tumours.10,11,17,15 After absorption, TMZ undergoes spontaneous nonenzymatic breakdown at physiological pH to form 5-(3-methyltriazen-1-yl) imidazole-4-carboxamide (MTIC), which then reacts with water to produce 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (AIC) and a highly reactive methyl diazonium cation.10 Brain tumours such as glioblastoma typically possess a more alkaline pH than healthy tissue, favouring TMZ activation within tumour tissue.10
The methyl diazonium cation is highly reactive and methylates DNA at the N7 position of guanine (N7-MeG, 70%), the N3 position of adenine (N3-MeA, 9%), and the O6 position of guanine (O6-MeG, 6%). Although more prevalent, N7-MeG and N3-MeA are rapidly repaired by the base excision repair pathway and are not primary mediators of temozolomide toxicity, although N3-MeA lesions are lethal if not repaired. By comparison, repair of O6-MeG requires action by the suicide enzyme methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), which removes the methyl group to restore guanine. If not repaired by MGMT, O6-MeG mispairs with thymine, activating the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) pathway that removes the thymine (not the O6-MeG), resulting in futile cycles of repair and eventual DNA strand breaks leading to apoptosis.10 As MMR activity is crucial for temozolomide cytotoxicity, cells that have reduced or absent MGMT function and an intact MMR pathway are the most sensitive to temozolomide treatment.10,11 Glioblastomas that upregulate MGMT downregulate MMR or alter both are resistant to TMZ, leading to treatment failure.10
More recently, increased interest has also been shown in the immunomodulatory effects of TMZ, related to its myelosuppressive effects. Counterintuitively, lymphodepletion may enhance the antitumour effects of cellular immunotherapy and improve the dynamics of memory cells by altering tumour-specific versus tumour-tolerant populations. The depletion of tumour-localized immunosuppressive Treg cells may contribute to an improved response to immunotherapy. Hence, TMZ treatment may also form the backbone of immunotherapy strategies against glioblastoma in the future.12

The mechanism of action of mirtazapine is not fully understoodLabel but may be explained by its effects on central adrenergic and serotonergic activity. This drug exhibits a fast onset of action, a high level of response, a manageable side-effect profile, and dual noradrenergic and serotonergic effects that are unique from the effects of other antidepressants.9
Effects on various receptors
It has been shown that both noradrenergic and serotonergic activity increase following mirtazapine administration. The results of these studies demonstrate mirtazapine exerts antagonist activity at presynaptic a2-adrenergic inhibitory autoreceptors and heteroreceptors in the central nervous system. This is thought to lead to enhanced noradrenergic and serotonergic activity Label, which are known to improve the symptoms of depression and form the basis of antidepressant therapy.24,25
Mirtazapine is a strong antagonist of serotonin 5-HT2 and 5-HT3 receptors. It has not been found to bind significantly to the serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors Label but indirectly increases 5-HT1A transmission.28
In addition to the above effects, mirtazapine is a peripheral a1-adrenergic antagonist. This action may explain episodes of orthostatic hypotension that have been reported after mirtazapine use.Label Mirtazapine is a potent histamine (H1) receptor antagonist, which may contribute to its powerful sedating effects.Label The pain-relieving effects of mirtazapine may be explained by its effects on opioid receptors.26,27

Na+/K+-ATPase on the basolateral membrane of proximal tubular cells utilize ATP to actively pump Na+ ions into the interstitium surrounding the tubule, establishing a Na+ gradient within the tubular cell. SGLT2 on the apical membrane of these cells then utilize this gradient to facilitate secondary active co-transport of both Na+ and glucose out of the filtrate, thereby reabsorbing glucose back into the blood – inhibiting this co-transport, then, allows for a marked increase in glucosuria and decrease in blood glucose levels.10 Empagliflozin is a potent inhibitor of renal SGLT2 transporters located in the proximal tubules of the kidneys and works to lower blood glucose levels via an increase in glucosuria.18
Empagliflozin also appears to exert cardiovascular benefits - specifically in the prevention of heart failure - independent of its blood glucose-lowering effects, though the exact mechanism of this benefit is not precisely understood. Several theories have been posited, including the potential inhibition of Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) 1 in the myocardium and NHE3 in the proximal tubule, reduction of pre-load via diuretic/natriuretic effects and reduction of blood pressure, prevention of cardiac fibrosis via suppression of pro-fibrotic markers, and reduction of pro-inflammatory adipokines.11

Beta2-adrenergic receptors are membrane-bound receptors that are normally activated by endogenous epinephrine whose signalling, via a downstream L-type calcium channel interaction, mediates smooth muscle relaxation and bronchodilation. Activation of the receptor stimulates an associated G protein which then activates adenylate cyclase, catalyzing the formation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and protein kinase A (PKA). Elevation of these two molecules induces bronchodilation by relaxation of airway smooth muscles.

The most common mutation, affecting approximately 70% of patients with CF worldwide, is known as F508del-CFTR or delta-F508 (<U+0394>F508), in which a deletion in the amino acid phenylalanine at position 508 results in impaired production of the CFTR protein, thereby causing a significant reduction in the amount of ion transporter present on cell membranes.7 Ivacaftor as monotherapy has failed to show a benefit for patients with delta-F508 mutations, most likely due to an insufficient amount of protein available at the cell membrane for interaction and potentiation by the drug.10 The next most common mutation, G551D, affecting 4-5% of CF patients worldwide is characterized as a missense mutation, whereby there is sufficient amount of protein at the cell surface, but opening and closing mechanisms of the channel are altered.9 Ivacaftor is indicated for the management of CF in patients with this second type of mutation, as it binds to and potentiates the channel opening ability of CFTR proteins on the cell membrane.9
Ivacaftor exerts its effect by acting as a potentiator of the CFTR protein, an ion channel involved in the transport of chloride and sodium ions across cell membranes of the lungs, pancreas, and other organs. Alterations in the CFTR gene result in altered production, misfolding, or function of the protein and consequently abnormal fluid and ion transport across cell membranes 5,6. Ivacaftor improves CF symptoms and underlying disease pathology by potentiating the channel open probability (or gating) of CFTR protein in patients with impaired CFTR gating mechanisms. The overall level of ivacaftor-mediated CFTR chloride transport is dependent on the amount of CFTR protein at the cell surface and how responsive a particular mutant CFTR protein is to ivacaftor potentiation 18.

AT1R mediates vasoconstriction, inflammation, fibrosis, and oxidative stress through a variety of signaling pathways. 5 These include Gq coupling to the inositol triphosphate pathway, activation of phospholipases C, A2, and D which contribute to eicosanoid production, activation of Ca2+-dependent and MAP kinases, Gi and G12/13, and eventual activation of the Jak/STAT pathway leading to cell growth and production of extracellular matrix components. AT1R activation also leads to increased activity of membrane-bound NADH/NADPH oxidase which contributes to production of reactive oxygen species. Decreased activation of this receptor mediates the renoprotective, antihypertensive, and cardioprotective effects of ramipril by reducing inflammation and vasoconstriction.
AT2R acts in opposition to the effects of AT1R by activating phosphotyrosine phosphatases which inhibit MAP kinases, inhibiting Ca2+ channel opening, and stimulating cGMP and nitric oxide production leading to vasodilation. 5 These counteracting effects are shared by the Mas receptor which is activated by Ang(1-7), a subtype of angiotensin produced by plasma esterases from AngI or by ACE2 from AngII produced through a secondary pathway by tonin and cathepsin G. Ang(1-7) also activates AT2R although the bulk of its effect is mediated by MasR.
ACE is also responsible for the breakdown of bradykinin. 5 The resulting buildup of bradykinin due to ACE inhibition is thought to mediate the characteristic dry-cough as a side effect of ACE inhibitor medications.

Somatic ACE has two functionally active domains, N and C, which arise from tandem gene duplication. Although the two domains have high sequence similarity, they play distinct physiological roles. The C-domain is predominantly involved in blood pressure regulation while the N-domain plays a role in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and proliferation. ACE inhibitors bind to and inhibit the activity of both domains, but have much greater affinity for and inhibitory activity against the C-domain. Trandolaprilat, the active metabolite of trandolapril, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII. Decreasing ATII levels in the body decreases blood pressure by inhibiting the pressor effects of ATII as described in the Pharmacology section above. Trandolaprilat also causes an increase in plasma renin activity likely due to a loss of feedback inhibition mediated by ATII on the release of renin and/or stimulation of reflex mechanisms via baroreceptors.

Amlodipine is considered a peripheral arterial vasodilator that exerts its action directly on vascular smooth muscle to lead to a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance, causing a decrease in blood pressure. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow-channel blocker) that inhibits the influx of calcium ions into both vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental studies imply that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites, located on cell membranes. The contraction of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent on the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells by specific ion channels. Amlodipine blocks calcium ion influx across cell membranes with selectivity. A stronger effect of amlodipine is exerted on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells Label. Direct actions of amlodipine on vascular smooth muscle result in reduced blood pressure 9. 
Mechanism of action in angina
The exact mechanism by which amlodipine relieves the symptoms of angina have not been fully elucidated to this date, however, the mechanism of action is likely twofold:
Amlodipine has a dilating effect on peripheral arterioles, reducing the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the cardiac muscle functions. Since the heart rate remains stable during amlodipine administration, the reduced work of the heart reduces both myocardial energy use and oxygen requirements 9.
Dilatation of the main coronary arteries and coronary arterioles, both in healthy and ischemic areas, is another possible mechanism of amlodipine reduction of blood pressure. The dilatation causes an increase in myocardial oxygen delivery in patients experiencing coronary artery spasm (Prinzmetal's or variant angina) and reduces coronary vasoconstriction caused by smoking 9.

Furthermore, mesalazine also has the potential to inhibit the activation of Nuclear Factor kappa B (NKkB) and consequently the production of key of pro-inflammatory cytokines Label. It has been proposed that reduced expression of PPAR gamma nuclear receptors (gamma form of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors) may be implicated in ulcerative colitis Label. There is evidence that mesalazine produces pharmacodynamic effects through direct activation of PPAR gamma receptors in the colonic/rectal epithelium as well Label.
Moreover, since increased leukocyte migration, abnormal cytokine production, increased production of arachidonic acid metabolites, particularly leukotriene B4, and increased free radical formation in the inflamed intestinal tissue are all present in patients with inflammatory bowel disease it is also believed that mesalazine has in-vitro and in-vivo pharmacological effects that inhibit leukocyte chemotaxis, decrease cytokine and leukotriene production and scavenge for free radicals 4.

It has significantly less activity at RAR-ß and RAR-a (16- and 65-fold lower than activity at RAR-<U+03B3>, respectively), and has no activity at retinoid X receptors (RXRs).1 Agonism at retinoic acid receptors results in dimerization, and the resulting receptor-ligand dimer binds to specific DNA regulatory sequences (retinoic acid response elements, or RAREs) in the promotor regions of retinoid-responsible genes. Downstream alterations to gene expression induced by binding to these regions is the principle mechanism through which trifarotene exerts its comedolytic, anti-inflammatory, and depigmenting effects.6
Like other retinoids, trifarotene influences the expression of a number of genes involved in retinoid metabolism, epidermal differentiation/proliferation, and epidermal response to stress. In addition, trifarotene appears to modulate retinoid-mediated pathways involved in proteolysis, skin hydration, and cell adhesion - modulation of these additional pathways has not been observed with other retinoids and may therefore be unique to trifarotene.1

Additionally, Src tyrosine kinases act as key modulators of cancer cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, migration, invasion and metastasis. Src is frequently upregulated in various epithelial tumours including colon, breast and pancreas compared with the adjacent normal tissues. The expression and activity of Src are also enhanced in human actinic keratosis, which is characterized by hyperproliferative premalignant skin lesions.8 The pathogenesis of actinic keratosis commonly involves skin inflammation, oxidative stress, immunosuppression, impaired apoptosis, mutagenesis, dysregulation of keratinocyte growth and proliferation, and tissue remodelling.7In vitro studies suggest that Src plays a predominant role in the early stages of human skin tumour development, rather than at later stages of tumour progression.8
The exact mechanism of tirbanibulin as a topical treatment of actinic keratosis has not been fully elucidated;11 however, it mainly works by inhibiting fast proliferating cells.3 Tirbanibulin is a non-ATP competitive Src kinase inhibitor and tubulin polymerization inhibitor. It binds to the peptide substrate binding site of Src, a primary target of tirbanibulin, and blocking its downstream signalling pathways that promote cancer cell migration, proliferation, and survival.3,5 Tublin is responsible for cell migration, protein transport, and mitosis: tibranibulin directly binds to the colchicine-binding site of beta-tubulin and causes induces tubulin depolymerization.2 It is also hypothesized that inhibition of Src can also contribute to the inhibitory effects on microtubule polymerization.9 At low nanomolar concentrations, tirbanibulin induces G2/M phase cell cycle arrest in a reversible 2,5 and dose-dependent manner. By inhibiting microtubule polymerization, tirbanibulin also induces mitotic catastrophe.9

In addition, aceclofenac interferes with neutrophil adhesion to endothelium by decreasing the expression of L-selectin (CD62L), which is a cell adhesion molecule expressed on lymphocytes 8. Aceclofenac is proposed to stimulate the synthesis of glycosaminoglycan in human osteoarthritic cartilage which may be mediated through its inhibitory action on IL-1 production and activity 1.

During the coagulation process, thrombin cleaves the Aa and Bß chains releasing fibrinopeptides A and B (FPA and FPB, respectively). FPA is separated rapidly and the remaining molecule is a soluble fibrin monomer (fibrin I). The slower removal of FPB results in formation of fibrin II that is capable of polymerization that occurs by aggregation of fibrin monomers. The resulting fibrin is stabilized in the presence of calcium ions and by activated factor XIII, which acts as a transglutaminase. Factor XIIIa-induced cross-linking of fibrin polymers renders the fibrin clot more elastic and more resistant to fibrinolysis.

Hyaluronic acid works by two basic mechanisms: serving as a passive structural molecule or serving as signaling molecule, depending on the molecule size. The physicochemical properties of high molecular weight HA contribute to passive structural effects, demonstrating hygroscopicity and viscoelasticity and improving hydration, water balance, and structural integrity. As a signalling molecule interacting with proteins, HA causes several opposing effects based on molecular weight: pro- or anti-inflammatory effects, promotion or inhibition of cell migration, and activating or inhibiting cell division.3
Hyaluronic acid exerts its therapeutic effects through binding to three primary types of cell surface receptors: CD44 (a membrane glycoprotein), the receptor for hyaluronate-mediated motility (RHAMM), and the Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM-1). CD44 is considered the most widely distributed receptor for hyaluronic acid, demonstrating cellular interactions with osteopontin, collagen, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). High and low molecular weight hyaluronic acids demonstrate differing molecular and cellular mechanisms in their interaction with CD44 receptors. Some examples of these effects include modification of chondrocyte survival pathways in addition to alteration of apoptosis pathways. Lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor (LYVE-1), and hyaluronic acid receptor for endocytosis (HARE), (also known as Stabilin-2) also bind to hyaluronic acid.2
Hyaluronic acid for skin conditions and cosmetics
Hyaluronic acid's anionic proprieties cause it to attract water and induce swelling, increasing tissue volume and skin structural integrity. The aging process is associated with reduced production of skin hyaluronic acid and collagen, causing the appearance of wrinkles and the loss of facial volume. Dermal fillers of hyaluronic acid replace lost tissue volume, imparting a full and youthful appearance to skin that has lost its elasticity. Hyaluronic acid fillers contain cross-linked hyaluronic acid particles, rendering a concentrated substance with resistance to various forms of physical and chemical breakdown. The cosmetic benefits of hyaluronic acid filler may last up to 6 months, depending on the brand and technique used for injection.17 Additionally, dermal hyaluronic acid fillers are known to increase the production of fibroblasts17, supporting wound healing and offering relief from irritating and inflammatory skin conditions.1
Hyaluronic acid for joint pain
Most cells in the human body are capable of synthesizing HA. It is a primary component of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and can be found in bone marrow, cartilage, and synovial fluid in joints.2 In osteoarthritis, the concentration of naturally occurring hyaluronic acid gradually decreases, lowering the viscosity of synovial fluid that protects joints from excess friction. Administration of intra-articular hyaluronic acid increases viscosity of synovial joint fluid, reducing friction and subsequently relieving painful arthritic symptoms.17
Hyaluronic acid for ophthalmic conditions and ophthalmological procedures
Solutions of hyaluronic acid with a concentration greater than 0.1% moisturize the surface of the eyes to treat symptoms of dry eye while improving the stabilization of tear film, replenishing deficiencies of HA, reducing friction, and preventing binding of foreign substances to the ocular tissue.2,17 Hyaluronic acid is frequently used during and after ophthalmological surgeries and plays important roles by virtue of its moisturizing, viscoelastic, and protective properties. It promotes tissue healing of the corneal epithelium and other parts of the eye following ophthalmological surgery, minimizing the risk of adhesions and free radical formation.2

Hypromellose also acts to lubricate and protect the eye 6.
The surface active properties of the vehicles found in artificial tears solutions act to stabilize the tear film and increase tear viscosity to prevent delay tear evaporation and delay tear drainage 4.
In the intact eye, the corneal surface is moistened primarily by the mucin that is produced in the conjunctiva. Mucin is adsorbed on the corneal surface and forms a hydrophilic surface. This creates a moisture barrier. In the typical dry eye, and particularly in case of mucin deficiency, the application of artificial tear fluid is highly recommended. Both its surface activity and its adsorptive capacity make hypromellose optimal for this use. Hypromellose has a physical-chemical action and leads to, in an aqueous solution, a reduced surface tension as well as an increased level of viscosity. Hypromellose adheres well to the cornea and conjunctiva and provides ample moisture. Irritation symptoms caused by blinking, which occur in the case of tear fluid deficiency, are therefore decreased and symptoms of epithelial desiccation are also alleviated 6.

It resembles oxytocin with has modifications at the 1, 2, 4, and 8 positions. The N-terminus of the cysteine residue is deaminated to form 3-mercaptopropanic acid at position 1, at position 2 L-tyrosine is modified to D-tyrosine with an ethoxy group replacing the phenol , threonine replaces glutamine at postion 4, and ornithine replaces leucine at position 8.
It binds to membrane bound oxytocin receptors on the myometrium and prevents oxytocin-stimulated increases in inositol triphosphate production 1. This ultimately prevents release of stored calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and subsequent opening of voltage gated calcium channels. This shutdown of cytosolic calcium increase prevents contractions of the uterine muscle, reducing the frequency of contractions and inducing uterine quiescence.
Atosiban has more recently been found to act as a biased ligand at oxytocin receptors 3,4. It acts as an antagonist of Gq coupling, explaining the inhibition of the inositol triphosphate pathway thought to be responsible for the effect on uterine contraction, but acts as an agonist of Gi coupling. This agonism produces a pro-inflammatory effect in the human amnion, activating pro-inflammatory signal tranducer NF-<U+03BA>B 4. It is thought that this reduces atosiban's effectiveness compared to agents which do not produce inflammation as inflammatory mediators are known to play a role in the induction of labour.

GLP-1 is a physiological hormone that promotes glycemic control via several different mechanisms, including insulin secretion, slowing gastric emptying, and reducing postprandial glucagon secretion. The homeostasis of glucose is dependent on hormones such as insulin and amylin, which are secreted by the beta cells of the pancreas. Semaglutide is 94% similar to human GLP-1. Analogs of this hormone such as semaglutide stimulate the synthesis of insulin3 by stimulating pancreatic islet cells and reducing glucagon secretion.3 They directly bind with selectivity to the GLP-1 receptor, causing various beneficial downstream effects that reduce blood glucose in a glucose-dependent fashion.15

In hypercholesterolemia, semaglutide is believed to reduce the progression of atherosclerosis via decreased gut permeability and decreased inflammation.7 Weight loss is believed to occur via the reduction of appetite and food cravings after semaglutide administration. 2,8

Clomifene appears to stumulate the release of gonadotropins, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and leuteinizing hormone (LH), which leads to the development and maturation of ovarian follicle, ovulation, and subsequent development and function of the coprus luteum, thus resulting in pregnancy. Gonadotropin release may result from direct stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis or from a decreased inhibitory influence of estrogens on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis by competing with the endogenous estrogens of the uterus, pituitary, or hypothalamus. Clomifene has no apparent progestational, androgenic, or antrandrogenic effects and does not appear to interfere with pituitary-adrenal or pituitary-thyroid function.

These cytokines increase the expression of host major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens and adhesion molecules which enhances the ability of mature donor T-cells to recognize these molecules. The activation of these donor T-cells results in the activation of mononuclear phagocytes, whose effector functions are triggered by stimulatory molecules generated by the damage incurred during the conditioning phase of treatment. Activated macrophages and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes begin to directly lyse target cells and/or cause their apoptosis, which eventually leads to local tissue damage and further inflammatory responses.3

It has a very low mean molecular weight (3600 Dalton), a long half-life (5.3 hrs) and a large anti-Xa: anti-IIa ratio (8:1)8. The mechanism of action of bemiparin is inhibition of factor Xa, which is a necessary step in the clotting cascade. Factor-Xa is necessary for the propagation of a thrombus.
Combined with various co-factors that bind to activated platelets, Factor-Xa increases coagulation by converting prothrombin to thrombin 11. Activated Factor-X, bound as part of the prothrombinase complex on the external surface of activated platelets, converts significant amounts of prothrombin to thrombin, promoting the so-called ‘thrombin burst’, referring to a burst of thrombin release 11. 
A secondary but less potent mechanism of action of this drug is binding to antithrombin III and activated factor II (Factor IIa), which further prevents the propagation of thrombi 14. 
Due to its excellent pharmacological profile-the second-generation LMWH with the lowest molecular weight, the longest half-life and the highest anti-Factor Xa/anti-Factor IIa activity ratio-it can be safely used in special categories of patients (children, elderly, patients with renal impairment and congestive heart failure).

It is possible that Li+ produces its effects by interacting with the transport of monovalent or divalent cations in neurons. An increasing number of scientists have come to the conclusion that the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate is the key factor in understanding how lithium works. Lithium has been shown to change the inward and outward currents of glutamate receptors (especially GluR3), without a shift in reversal potential. Lithium has been found to exert a dual effect on glutamate receptors, acting to keep the amount of glutamate active between cells at a stable, healthy level, neither too much nor too little. It is postulated that too much glutamate in the space between neurons causes mania, and too little, depression. Another mechanism by which lithium might help to regulate mood include the non-competitive inhibition of an enzyme called inositol monophosphatase. Alternately lithium's action may be enhanced through the deactivation of the GSK-3B enzyme. The regulation of GSK-3B by lithium may affect the circadian clock. GSK-3 is known for phosphorylating and thus inactivating glycogen synthase. GSK-3B has also been implicated in the control of cellular response to damaged DNA. GSK-3 normally phosphorylates beta catenin, which leads to beta catenin degratation. When GSK-3 is inhibited, beta catenin increases and transgenic mice with overexpression of beta catenin express similar behaviour to mice treated with lithium. These results suggest that increase of beta catenin may be a possible pathway for the therapeutic action of lithium.

Orexigenic and anorexigenic neurons contain prohormone convertase 1/3 (PC1/3), which is encoded by the gene proprotein subtilisin/kexin type 1.4 PC1/3 preforms activation cleavage of a number of peptide hormone precursors, including a-melanocyte simulating hormone.4
Setmelanotide is a pro-opiomelanocortin derived peptide that is an agonist of MC4R.1 It is an approximately 20-fold more potent agonist of MC4R than endogenous a-melanocyte stimulating hormone, with an EC50 of 0.27 nM.3,1 By directly agonizing MC4R, upstream genetic deficiencies in the MC4R signalling pathway cannot inhibit satiety, food intake is decreased, and weight loss is achieved.1,3,4
MC4R is a 332 amino acid G-protein coupled receptor (G-PCR).3 Although the lack of cardiovascular adverse effects with setmelanotide treatment are not well understood, it is believed that earlier MC4R antagonists activated multiple G-protein signalling pathways.1 Earlier drugs that targeted G-PCRs either bound with high affinity to the highly conserved orthosteric binding site, or with high specificity to less conserved allosteric sites.3 Setmelanotide is an atypical bitopic ligand that interacts with both the orthosteric and putative allosteric binding site, allowing for both high affinity and specificity.3

Antigen is presented to T cells by being ingested by antigen presenting cells (APC), which then present it on their surface to lymphocytes in combination with various MHC molecules once they reach local lymph nodes 4. Tuberculin PPD most likely interacts with toll-like receptor 2 expressed on APCs that initiates an inflammatory response. Subsequent restimulation of these sensitized lymphocytes with the same or a similar antigen, such as the intradermal injection of tuberculin PPD, evokes a local reaction mediated by these cells. This reaction is referred to as a delayed-type hypersensitivity response that includes vasodilation, edema, and the infiltration of lymphocytes, basophils, monocytes, and neutrophils into the site of antigen injection. The sensitized antigen-specific T lymphocytes proliferate and release lymphokines, which mediate the accumulation of other cells at the site 5. In vitro studies show that Tuberculin PPD promotes the upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in T lymphocytes through major histocompatibility (MHC) class II interaction with CD4+ T lymphocyte interaction 3. The reactions are evident after 5-6 hours following administration.

Cushing’s disease - another less common cause of Cushing’s syndrome - is generally the result of increased endogenous cortisol exposure due to excessive secretion of adrenocroticotrophic hormone (ACTH) from a pituitary adenoma.5
Osilodrostat is an inhibitor of 11ß-hydroxylase (CYP11B1) and, to a lesser extent, aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2).6 The CYP11B1 enzyme is responsible for catalyzing the final step of cortisol synthesis - by inhibiting this enzyme, osilodrostat helps to normalize endogenous cortisol levels and alleviate symptoms of Cushing’s disease.6

Subsequently, these actions may provoke coughing that can ultimately flush difficult to access, congealed mucopurulent material from obstructed small airways to facilitate a temporary improvement for the individual 4.
Consequently, while it is generally proposed that guaifenesin functions as an expectorant by helping to loosen phlegm (mucus) and thin bronchial secretions to rid the bronchial passageways of bothersome mucus and make coughs more productive, there has also been research to suggest that guaifenesin possesses and is capable of demonstrating anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant effects to some degree possibly by acting as an NMDA receptor antagonist 3.

The hetero-octomeric complex of the channel is composed of four pore-forming Kir6.2 subunits and four regulatory sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits. Alternative splicing allows the formation of channels composed of varying subunit isoforms expressed at different concentrations in different tissues.7 In pancreatic beta cells, ATP-sensitive potassium channels play a role as essential metabolic sensors and regulators that couple membrane excitability with glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS).6 When there is a decrease in the ATP:ADP ratio, the channels are activated and open, leading to K+ efflux from the cell, membrane hyperpolarization, and suppression of insulin secretion.6 In contrast, increased uptake of glucose into the cell leads to elevated intracellular ATP:ADP ratio, leading to the closure of channels and membrane depolarization. Depolarization leads to activation and opening of the voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and consequently an influx of calcium ions into the cell.6 Elevated intracellular calcium levels causes the contraction of the filaments of actomyosin responsible for the exocytosis of insulin granules stored in vesicles.3 Glimepiride blocks the ATP-sensitive potassium channel by binding non-specifically to the B sites of both sulfonylurea receptor-1 (SUR1) and sulfonylurea receptor-2A (SUR2A) subunits as well as the A site of SUR1 subunit of the channel to promote insulin secretion from the beta cell.3

Ponatinib is unique in that it is especially useful in the treatment of resistant CML because it inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of Abl and T315I mutant kinases. The T315I mutation confers resistance in cells as it prevents other Bcr-Abl inhibitors from binding to the Abl kinase. Other targets that ponatinib inhibits are members of the VEGFR, PDGFR, FGFR, EPH receptors and SRC families of kinases, and KIT, RET, TIE2, and FLT3. A decrease in tumour size expressing native or T315I mutant BCR-ABL have been observed in rats.

The direct cytotoxic effect of TNF-a is mediated by TNF-a receptor 1 2. The bound receptor activates the well-reviewed death receptor pathway involving the activation of initiator caspases 8 and 9 then ultimately ending in the activation of effector caspase 3 which begins the process of apoptosis.
The effect on tumor vasculature is mediated by the inflammatory signalling pathway of TNF-a, the NF<U+03BA>B pathway 2. This pathway is also activated by TNFR1 when bound to TNFa. The NF<U+03BA>B transcription factor increases expression of proteins in vascular endothelial cells. These proteins include cell adhesion molecules, inflammatory mediators like prostaglandins and interleukins, and growth factors 4. TNF-&alpha also increases the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase via this pathway which contributes to the generation of reactive nitrogen species 3. These species are able to damage cells in the tumor and microvasculature.
The cytokines produced from NF<U+03BA>B activation and TNF-&aplha; itself serve to activate the cells of the immune system which further damage tumor cells with respiratory bursts, phagocytosis and subsequent breakdown of the cell, and release of cytotoxic enzymes. The antigen presenting cells which phagocytose the tumor cells are able to activate lymphocytes and allow the adaptive immune system to further damage the tumor tissue 5.

After uptake into malignant cells, gemcitabine is phosphorylated by deoxycytidine kinase to form gemcitabine monophosphate, which is then converted to the active compounds, gemcitabine diphosphate (dFdCDP) and gemcitabine triphosphate (dFdCTP). These active metabolites are nucleosides that mediate antitumour effects. dFdCTP competes with deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) for incorporation into DNA, thereby competitively inhibiting DNA chain elongation. The non-terminal position of dFdCTP in the DNA chain prevents detection of dFdCTP in the chain and repair by proof-reading 3'5'-exonuclease: this process is referred to as \masked DNA chain termination.\ Incorporation of dFdCTP into the DNA chain ultimately leads to chain termination, DNA fragmentation, and apoptotic cell death of malignant cells.2,3,4
Gemcitabine has self-potentiating pharmacological actions that can increase the probability of successful incorporation of gemcitabine triphosphate into the DNA chain: dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, an enzyme responsible for catalyzing the reactions that generate dCTP for DNA synthesis. Since dFdCDP reduces the levels of dCTP, there is less competition for gemcitabine triphosphate for incorporation into DNA.2,4 Gemcitabine can also reduce metabolism and elimination of active metabolites from the target ce1l, prolonging high intracellular concentrations of the active metabolites. Such self-potentiating effects are not present with cytarabine.2

When the estrogen receptor has bound its ligand it can enter the nucleus of the target cell, and regulate gene transcription which leads to formation of messenger RNA. The mRNA interacts with ribosomes to produce specific proteins that express the effect of estradiol upon the target cell. Estrogens increase the hepatic synthesis of sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), and other serum proteins and suppress follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary.

Subsequently it is also a metabolite in the glutathione cycle that is converted to glutamate by the enzyme 5-oxoprolinase 4,7. Moreover, N-terminal glutamic acid and glutamine residues can either spontaneously cyclize to become pidolic acid, or be enzymatically transformed by glutaminyl cyclases 4,7. In particular, this is ultimately a form of N-termini that is a challenge for N-terminal sequencing using Edman chemistry, which necessitates a free primary amino group that is not present in pidolic acid 4,7. Pyroglutamate aminopeptidase can restore a free N-terminus by cleaving off the pyroglutamate residue, however 4,7.
Additionally, pidolic acid and certain pidolic acid salts like calcium, magnesium, and potassium pidolic acid are sometimes used as skin or hair conditioning agents because of their humectant effects 9. In such humectant formulations, hydrophilic amine, hydroxyl, or even carboxyl groups possess high affinities for forming hydrogen bonds with molecules of water, allowing the hygroscopic formulations to attract and retain moisture in the air nearby through absorption, therefore drawing the water vapor into the formulation.

Pyrazinoic acid can leak out under acidic conditions to be converted to the protonated conjugate acid, which is readily diffused back into the bacilli and accumulate intracellularly. The net effect is that more pyrazinoic acid accumulates inside the bacillus at acid pH than at neutral pH. Pyrazinoic acid was thought to inhibit the enzyme fatty acid synthase (FAS) I, which is required by the bacterium to synthesise fatty acids. However, this theory was thought to have been discounted.5 However, further studies reproduced the results of FAS I inhibition as the putative mechanism first in whole cell assay of replicating M. tuberculosis bacilli which have shown that pyrazinoic acid and its ester inhibit the synthesis of fatty acids.6 This study was followed by in vitro assay of tuberculous FAS I enzyme that tested the activity with pyrazinamide, pyrazinoic acid and several classes of pyrazinamide analogs. Pyrazinamide and its analogs inhibited the activity of purified FAS I.7
It has also been suggested that the accumulation of pyrazinoic acid disrupts membrane potential and interferes with energy production, necessary for survival of M. tuberculosis at an acidic site of infection. Pyrazinoic acid has also been shown to bind to the ribosomal protein S1 (RpsA) and inhibit trans-translation. This may explain the ability of the drug to kill dormant mycobacteria.8

Somatic ACE has two functionally active domains, N and C, which arise from tandem gene duplication. Although the two domains have high sequence similarity, they play distinct physiological roles. The C-domain is predominantly involved in blood pressure regulation while the N-domain plays a role in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and proliferation. ACE inhibitors bind to and inhibit the activity of both domains, but have much greater affinity for and inhibitory activity against the C-domain. Fosinoprilat, the active metabolite of fosinopril, competes with ATI for binding to ACE and inhibits and enzymatic proteolysis of ATI to ATII. Decreasing ATII levels in the body decreases blood pressure by inhibiting the pressor effects of ATII as described in the Pharmacology section above. Fosinoprilat also causes an increase in plasma renin activity likely due to a loss of feedback inhibition mediated by ATII on the release of renin and/or stimulation of reflex mechanisms via baroreceptors.

It serves as the hormonal mediator for the hyperplasia upon accumulation within the prostate gland.7 DHT displays a higher affinity towards androgen receptors in the prostate gland compared to testosterone10 and by acting on the androgen receptors, DHT modulates genes that are responsible for cell proliferation.9 Responsible for the production of DHT together with type I 5a-reductase, the type II 5a-reductase isozyme is primarily found in the prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymides, and hair follicles as well as liver.11 Although finasteride is 100-fold more selective for type II 5a-reductase than for the type I isoenzyme,3 chronic treatment with this drug may have some effect on type I 5a-reductase, which is predominantly expressed in sebaceous glands of most regions of skin, including the scalp, and liver. It is proposed that the type I 5a-reductase and type II 5a-reductase is responsible for the production of one-third and two-thirds of circulating DHT, respectively. 
The mechanism of action of Finasteride is based on its preferential inhibition of Type II 5a-reductase through the formation of a stable complex with the enzyme in vitro and in vivo.13 Finasteride works selectively, where it preferentially displays a 100-fold selectivity for the human Type II 5a-reductase over type I enzyme.11 Inhibition of Type II 5a-reductase blocks the peripheral conversion of testosterone to DHT, resulting in significant decreases in serum and tissue DHT concentrations, minimal to moderate increase in serum testosterone concentrations, and substantial increases in prostatic testosterone concentrations. As DHT appears to be the principal androgen responsible for stimulation of prostatic growth, a decrease in DHT concentrations will result in a decrease in prostatic volume (approximately 20-30% after 6-24 months of continued therapy). It is suggested that increased levels of DHT can lead to potentiated transcription of prostaglandin D2, which promotes the proliferation of prostate cancer cells.4 In men with androgenic alopecia, the mechanism of action has not been fully determined, but finasteride has shown to decrease scalp DHT concentration to the levels found in the hairy scalp, reduce serum DHT, increase hair regrowth, and slow hair loss. Another study suggests that finasteride may work to reduce bleeding of prostatic origin by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the prostate, leading to atrophy and programmed cell death.3 This may bestow the drug therapeutic benefits in patients idiopathic prostatic bleeding, bleeding during anticoagulation, or bleeding after instrumentation.3

In terms of bismuth subgallate's ability to deodorize flatulence and stools as an internal deodorant - although not fully elucidated - it is believed that when the substance is administered orally, its relative insolubility and poor absorption allows it to remain within the gastrointestinal lumen and inhibit colonic bacteria from acting on fermentable food residues in the GI tract 14.
Moreover, when bismuth subgallate is taken orally, various salts like bismuth citrate, bismuth oxychloride, and others are formed 6. These salts are then taken up into surrounding gastric mucus as well as bound to protein within the base of any ulcers that may be present after coming into contact with gastric juice 6. Additionally, bismuth compounds like bismuth subgallate are also believed to have the capacity to trigger the secretion of prostaglandins, epithelial growth factor (EGF), and mucosal bicarbonate as a means to inhibit the action of pepsin in gastric juice 6. These actions subsequently protect gastric mucous from peptic luminal degradation as well as enhance the properties of mucous to assist in the healing of both duodenal and gastric ulcers 6. In this way, bismuth subgallate works to absorb extra water and/or toxins in the large intestine, allowing it to form a protective coat on the intestinal mucosa and over ulcers that may or may not be associated with infections like those of Helicobacter pylori 13.
Furthermore, studies have shown that bismuth compounds like bismuth subgallate are capable of demonstrating antimicrobial effects against various gastrointestinal tract pathogens like E. coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio cholera, Campylobacter jejuni, H. pylori, and some enteric viruses like Rotaviruses 6. Although the exact mechanism(s) of action by which bismuth compounds are able to elicit such antimicrobial effects remains unclear 6, a number of experimental observations suggest that bismuth has been able to complex with the bacterial wall and periplasmic membrane; inhibit bacterial enzymes like urease, catalase, and lipase; inhibit bacterial protein and ATP synthesis; and also inhibit or decrease the adherence of bacteria like H. pylori to epithelial cells 6. In essence, ultrastructural studies have shown evidence of the binding of bismuth complexes to the bacterial wall and periplasmic space between the inner and outer bacterial membrane of H.pylori with subsequent ballooning and disintegration of the pathogen 6. To various extents, these antimicrobial actions may also illustrate how bismuth subgallate is capable of neutralizing colonic bacteria from acting on fermentable foods as well.
Numerous studies have and continue to study the possible hemostatic action that bismuth subgallate may have. As the bismuth salt of gallic acid, bismuth subgallate's chemical structure shares similarities to ellagic acid, another gallic acid derivative 7. Ellagic acid itself is a clot-promoting agent that initiates thrombin formation by way of the intrinsic pathway via an action on Hageman factor (clotting factor XII) 7,4. It is believed that bismuth subgallate's ability to activate factor XII is associated with the chemical's negatively charged moieties - whose contact with factor XII would theoretically initiate the intrinsic pathway to blood clotting 7.
Other studies have also suggested that bismuth subgallate is capable of inducing macrophages to secrete growth factors to facilitate wound healing, decreasing lesion area, enhancing granulation tissue formation and re-epithelialization, the initiation of the proliferation of collagen via the activation of fibroblasts, the accelerated re-establishment of blood vessels, and also the restriction of nitric oxide formation 5,8.
Given such studies regarding bismuth subgallate's potential hemostatic abilities, there has been and continues to be interest in indicating the agent for use in otolaryngology as in tonsillectomies or adenotonsillectomies to achieve reduced bleeding and surgery times; topical treatment in various open wound surgeries to facilitate faster and earlier clotting between tissues; ileostomy; dental surgeries; epistaxis management; among others 2,4. Nevertheless, study results are conflicting; where there may be experimental results suggesting some improvements in reduced operation time and operative blood loss when bismuth subgallate is used as a hemostatic agent in tonsillectomies 7 there are also study results that observed bismuth subgallate having a negative influence on the healing processes of wounds inflicted in animal models, in which the use of the agent actually delayed the rate of new vessel formation and optimal wound healing 4.
Finally, bismuth subgallate also demonstrates a strong astringent ability 4 - an action that can facilitate both its deodorant and hemostatic effects and assists in its indication as an active ingredient in a number of non-prescription products for hemorrhoid suppositories or topical applications, diarrhea, etc 14."

Valproate is known to inhibit succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase.12 This inhibition results in an increase in succinic semialdehyde which acts as an inhibitor of GABA transaminase ultimately reducing GABA metabolism and increasing GABAergic neurotransmission. As GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, this increase results in increased inhibitory activity.1 A possible secondary contributor to cortical inhibition is a direct suppression of voltage gated sodium channel activity and indirect suppression through effects on GABA.
It has also been suggested that valproate impacts the extracellular signal-related kinase pathway (ERK).1 These effects appear to be dependent on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) and result in the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. This activation increases expression of several downstream targets including ELK-1 with subsequent increases in c-fos, growth cone-associated protein-43 which contributes to neural plasticity, B-cell lymphoma/leukaemia-2 which is an anti-apoptotic protein, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which is also involved in neural plasticity and growth. Increased neurogenesis and neurite growth due to valproate are attributed to the effects of this pathway. An additional downstream effect of increased BDNF expression appears to be an increase in GABAA receptors which contribute further to increased GABAergic activity.13
Valproate exerts a non-competitive indirect inhibitory effect on myo-inosital-1-phophate synthetase.14 This results in reduced de novo synthesis of inositol monophosphatase and subsequent inositol depletion. It is unknown how this contributed to valproate's effects on bipolar disorder but [lithium] is known to exert a similar inositol-depleting effect.15 Valproate exposure also appears to produce down-regulation of protein kinase C proteins (PKC)-a and -e which are potentially related to bipolar disorder as PKC is unregulated in the frontal cortex of bipolar patients. This is further supported by a similar reduction in PKC with lithium.16 The inhibition of the PKC pathway may also be a contributor to migraine prophylaxis.17 Myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate, a PKC substrate, is also downregulated by valproate and may contribute to changes in synaptic remodeling through effects on the cytoskeleton.18
Valproate also appears to impact fatty acid metabolism.1 Less incorporation of fatty acid substrates in sterols and glycerolipids is thought to impact membrane fluidity and result in increased action potential threshold potentially contributing to valproate's antiepileptic action.19 Valproate has been found to be a non-competitive direct inhibitor of brain microsomal long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase.20 Inhibition of this enzyme decreases available arichidonyl-CoA, a substrate in the production of inflammatory prostaglandins. It is thought that this may be a mechanism behind valproate's efficacy in migraine prophylaxis as migraines are routinely treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs which also inhibit prostaglandin production.
Finally, valproate acts as a direct histone deactylase (HDAC) inhibitor.22 Hyperacetylation of lysine residues on histones promoted DNA relaxation and allows for increased gene transcription. The scope of valproate's genomic effects is wide with 461 genes being up or down-regulated.21 The relation of these genomic effects to therapeutic value is not fully characterized however H3 and H4 hyperacetylation correlates with improvement of symptoms in bipolar patients.23 Histone hyperacetylation at the BDNF gene, increasing BDNF expression, post-seizure is known to occur and is thought to be a neuroprotective mechanism which valproate may strengthen or prolong.24 H3 hyperacetylation is associated with a reduction in glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a pro-apoptotic enzyme, contributing further to valproate's neuroprotective effects.25

Imiquimod also induced the expression of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor alpha genes. In the treatment of basal cell carcinoma, Imiquimod appears to act as a toll-like receptor-7 agonist, and is thought to exert its anti-tumor effect via modification of the immune response and stimulation of apoptosis in BCC cells.

Cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiotherapy are associated with the release of serotonin (5-HT) from enterochromaffin cells of the small intestine, presumably initiating a vomiting reflex through stimulation of 5-HT3 receptors located on vagal afferents 8,9,10. Ondansetron may block the initiation of this reflex. Activation of vagal afferents may also cause a central release of serotonin from the chemoreceptor trigger zone of the area postrema, located on the floor of the fourth ventricle 8,9,10. Thus, the antiemetic effect of ondansetron is probably due to the selective antagonism of 5-HT3 receptors on neurons located in either the peripheral or central nervous systems, or both 8,9,10.
Although the mechanisms of action of ondansetron in treating postoperative nausea and vomiting and cytotoxic induced nausea and vomiting may share similar pathways, the role of ondansetron in opiate-induced emesis has not yet been formally established 9,10.
